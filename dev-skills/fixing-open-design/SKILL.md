# fixing-open-design — capability-barrel refactor template

Refactor a backend subsystem of `nexu-io/open-design` into the **machine-enforced capability-barrel architecture**, using `apps/daemon/src/design-systems/` as the proven reference implementation, then open a PR.

> **Agent-agnostic.** This is a plain `SKILL.md` — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, or any agent can follow it. It names *capabilities* ("track progress as a task list", "ask the user", "run this command"), never a specific tool API. Map each capability to whatever your harness provides. Nothing here requires Claude-specific tooling.

**The reference is the spec.** Everything this skill asks you to produce already exists, done correctly, in `apps/daemon/src/design-systems/`. When any instruction here is ambiguous, open that module and copy its shape exactly — its `README.md`, its `core/index.ts` barrel, its `@module` docblocks, its `scripts/check-barrel-imports.ts` registration. Do not invent a variant.

> Scope: this template is for **backend/daemon TypeScript modules** (a flat directory of many files, or a multi-thousand-line god-file). Front-end (`apps/web`) refactor guidance is a planned separate addition — do not stretch this skill to cover it yet.

`$SKILL_DIR` below = the directory containing this `SKILL.md`. Read the four reference files before you start — they carry the depth this file only summarizes:

- `references/architecture.md` — **the WHY.** Foundation kernel, acyclic edges, barrels, cycle-breaking, why it's machine-enforced. Read this first; the mechanics only make sense once the reasoning does.
- `references/barrel-and-guard.md` — the 7 enforced rules, the `CapabilityBarrelDomain` registry, how to register a new domain.
- `references/jsdoc-and-docs.md` — `@module` docblocks, per-function JSDoc, `@internal`, barrel descriptions, and the module `README.md` requirement.
- `references/merge-and-pr.md` — validation commands, the isolated-worktree merge technique, the PR body template, and cross-repo push.

## Guardrails (read before touching code)

1. **Public API stays export-surface-stable.** The whole point is a structural move that external importers never notice. The set of names exported from the module's root barrel must be identical before and after (runtime behavior unchanged too). Prove it (Phase 6). ("Byte-identical" applies only to *moved function bodies* — the move discipline — not to the barrel text.)
2. **No behavior changes in the same PR.** This is a strangler-fig *move*. If you spot a bug or a tempting cleanup, note it for a follow-up PR — do not fold it in. A refactor PR whose diff contains logic changes is un-reviewable.
3. **One subsystem per PR.** The design-systems PR (#5088) refactored exactly one module. Keep that bound.
4. **Every file gets a `@module` docblock; every exported function gets JSDoc.** This is a hard acceptance bar, not a nicety — see `references/jsdoc-and-docs.md`.
5. **The guard must actually enforce the result.** A capability-barrel refactor without a passing `check-barrel-imports` registration is incomplete — the boundaries would rot immediately.

Track the phases below as a task/todo list (use your harness's task tracker if it has one) so progress stays visible.

## Tooling accelerators (use when available, degrade gracefully)

Two classes of accelerator make this skill markedly cheaper. Neither is required — every phase works with plain grep/file-reads and inline writing — but when your harness offers them, default to using them:

1. **Cheap-model delegation for mechanical writing.** Summarizing files and drafting JSDoc/`@module` docblocks is high-volume work. Delegate it to a cheaper/faster model as a subagent — on Claude Code, use **Sonnet** (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`) subagents; don't drop below Sonnet-class, as Haiku-class models produced unreliable file summaries in practice. Prime targets: the per-file summaries feeding Phase 1's inventory, and Phase 5's docblock/barrel-description first drafts. The senior model (you) keeps everything requiring judgment: clustering, edge design, cycle-breaking, the guard registry, and **review of every delegated block** — a wrong docblock is worse than none.
2. **Code-graph backends for search and understanding.** If **codebase-memory-mcp** or **graphify** is available (see `AI-Dev-Shop/integrations/`), prefer them over broad manual reading for: initial repo/module mapping, symbol and file lookup, who-calls-what / import-edge tracing (Phase 1's dependency graph), and impact checks when rewriting external importers (Phase 3.5). Validate any load-bearing graph finding against the actual source before acting on it, and fall back to `rg`/direct reads when graph evidence is weak or the backend isn't installed. Do not silently install a backend — surface the cost and ask first.

---

## Phase 0 — Confirm the target and baseline

1. Identify the subsystem (e.g. `apps/daemon/src/<module>/` or a `<module>.ts` god-file). Confirm it with the user if unstated.
2. Capture a green baseline **before touching anything**: run the module's existing tests and the package typecheck, and record the numbers. You will diff against this at the end. If the baseline is already red, stop and surface that — do not refactor on top of a broken base.
3. `git status` — if the working tree is dirty with unrelated work, plan to commit selectively (`git add <specific paths>`) and, for any `main` merge, use the isolated-worktree technique in `references/merge-and-pr.md`.

## Phase 1 — Map the module and design the layout

Read `references/architecture.md` first, then:

1. **Inventory** every file/symbol in the subsystem. For a god-file, list its top-level functions/types/consts. This is the prime spot for the Tooling accelerators above: a code-graph backend (codebase-memory-mcp / graphify) gives you the symbol list and import edges cheaply, and per-file summaries can be delegated to Sonnet-class subagents instead of reading every file yourself.
2. **Cluster by concern**, not by type. design-systems landed on `core / catalog / user / import / tokens / jobs` — yours will differ. Name subdirectories after *what the code does* (read/catalog, write/CRUD, import pipeline, extraction, job store), never after language kind (`utils`, `helpers`, `types`).
3. **Identify the `core/` foundation kernel**: the shared types and pure primitives that many concerns need and that depend on nothing else in the module. Everything may import `core/`; `core/` imports no sibling. See `references/architecture.md` → "The foundation kernel".
4. **Map the dependency graph between clusters.** A code-graph backend's import/call-edge queries are the fast path here; verify surprising edges against the source. Draw the directed edges. Any **cycle** must be broken *before* the split — the standard fix is to relocate the shared piece causing the cycle down into `core/` (design-systems moved `readUserMetadata` into `core/metadata.ts` to break a `catalog ↔ user` cycle). Do **not** plan a two-way edge; that's the smell the whole architecture exists to prevent.
5. Write down the final **`allowedEdges`** (directed, acyclic, `[from, to]`). This list is small on purpose. If it's large, your clustering is wrong — revisit step 2.
6. Get the layout signed off (a short clarifying question or a written plan) before mass file moves — reorganizing is expensive to redo.

## Phase 2 — Extract `core/` and break cycles

1. Create `core/`. Move all shared **types** into `core/types.ts`. Move pure **primitives** (parsers, path/id utilities, metadata read helpers) into focused `core/*.ts` files.
2. Relocate any cycle-causing shared symbol into `core/` (per Phase 1.4).
3. Give `core/` a barrel `core/index.ts`. Subdir barrels **may** use `export *` (the reference's `core/index.ts` and `catalog/index.ts` do); only the **root** barrel must use explicit named re-exports (guard Rule 7). Prefer named exports where a subdir's surface is small and stable, but `export *` from a subdir is allowed.
4. `core/` must not import from any sibling subdirectory — verify by eye now; the guard will enforce it later.

## Phase 3 — Split into concern subdirectories with barrels

1. Move each cluster's files into its subdirectory. Keep functions **byte-identical** during the move — no edits beyond the import-path rewrites the move forces.
2. Each subdirectory gets a barrel `index.ts` re-exporting its public surface (named exports or `export *` — subdir barrels may use either) with a `@module` description (see `references/jsdoc-and-docs.md`).
3. Cross-subdir imports go **only** along a declared `allowedEdges` edge, and **only through the sibling's barrel** (`../<sibling>/index.js`) — never a private file. Same-subdir and `core/` imports are unrestricted.
4. Build the module **root barrel** `index.ts`: explicit named re-exports from the subdir barrels only, reproducing the *exact* prior public surface. No `export *`.
5. Rewrite every **external** importer (other daemon files that used the old flat paths) to import from the root barrel. Grep the whole `apps/daemon/src` tree for old paths and fix all of them.

## Phase 4 — Register and wire the guard

Follow `references/barrel-and-guard.md`:

1. Add the domain to `CAPABILITY_BARREL_DOMAINS` in `scripts/check-barrel-imports.ts` (`name`, `root`, `subdirs`, `foundation`, `allowedEdges`).
2. Confirm it's in the `pnpm guard` chain (the design-systems entry already wired `scripts/check-barrel-imports.test.ts` into guard; a new domain reuses the same machinery — you're only adding a registry entry, not new scan code).
3. Run the guard; fix every violation by correcting the *import*, not by loosening the rules. If a rule genuinely can't be satisfied, that's a design signal — revisit the clustering, don't add an exception.

## Phase 5 — Document: JSDoc every function, `@module` every file, write the README

This is a hard acceptance bar. See `references/jsdoc-and-docs.md` for the exact conventions. In brief:

1. **Every file** starts with a `/** @module <name> ... */` docblock explaining what the file owns and how it relates to siblings.
2. **Every exported function/type** gets JSDoc (`@param`, `@returns`, and *why* it exists). Private helpers get a short block tagged `@internal`.
3. **Every barrel** carries a one-line description of the layer's responsibility.
4. Write/refresh the module's `README.md` mirroring `design-systems/README.md`: What changed · Why this shape · Import conventions · Known limitations & staged migration · Directory structure · Types.
5. **Default accelerator:** delegate the mechanical docblock/barrel-description drafting to a cheaper/faster model as a subagent when your harness supports it — on Claude Code, Sonnet subagents (Haiku-class models proved too error-prone for this). *You* review every block for accuracy; a wrong docblock is worse than none. If you can't delegate, write them inline.

## Phase 6 — Validate (nothing is done until this is green)

Run, in order, and record real numbers (see `references/merge-and-pr.md` for exact commands):

1. `node --import tsx --test scripts/check-barrel-imports.test.ts` — the guard's own suite.
2. `pnpm guard` — includes the barrel check across all registered domains.
3. `pnpm --filter @open-design/daemon typecheck` — **src *and* tests** must be clean.
4. The module's targeted test suite — must match or beat the Phase 0 baseline.
5. **Public-surface diff:** confirm the root barrel exports the exact same names as before (e.g. diff the old vs new export list). This is the "external importers unaffected" proof.

If you merged `main` mid-flight, re-home any features `main` added to the *old* structure into the *new* split files (main will keep editing the monolith while your PR is open) — see `references/merge-and-pr.md`. An independent second-model audit of the merge caught real dropped-import blockers on the reference PR; consider one for non-trivial merges.

## Phase 7 — Open the PR

Use the template in `$SKILL_DIR/templates/pr-body.md` and the process in `references/merge-and-pr.md`:

1. Commit **only** the refactor's files (`git add <paths>`), never unrelated WIP. No co-author trailers (repo policy).
2. Fill the PR body: **Why** (both your use case *and* the pain — tech debt / unenforceable boundaries), **What users will see** (nothing; internal refactor, public API identical; name the QA regression surface), **What this does**, **Scope / boundary**, **Surface area** (template checklist — a pure refactor is `None`), **Validation** (the real Phase 6 numbers).
3. Cross-repo PRs push to the contributor's **fork** remote, not `origin` (upstream 403s). Verify with `gh pr view <n> --json headRepositoryOwner,isCrossRepository`.
4. If a reviewer flags that the guard's scope doesn't match a promise in the description, prefer **narrowing the wording** to what's actually enforced (runtime code under `apps/daemon/src`; tests may white-box internals but public-surface tests still import via the barrel) over widening the scan — see `references/barrel-and-guard.md` → "Scope is runtime code, by design".
