# Skill: Spec Writing

Specs are ground truth. Every downstream agent — Software Architect, TDD, Programmer, Code Review, Security — builds on what the spec says. If the spec is wrong or vague, every agent executes confidently on a flawed foundation and produces passing tests for the wrong behavior. This is the most dangerous failure mode in a multi-agent system.

## What a Spec Is

A spec converts fuzzy product intent into precise, versioned, testable statements. It answers:
- What problem are we solving?
- What does done look like, in observable terms?
- What is explicitly out of scope?
- What are the hard constraints?
- What are the edge cases?

A spec is not implementation guidance. It does not say how to build something — only what the system must do and prove.

## Spec Anatomy

Every spec must include:

**Header Metadata**
```
Spec ID:      SPEC-001
Version:      1.2.0
Last Edited:  2026-02-21T14:00:00Z
Hash:         sha256:<hash of canonical content>
```

The hash is a fingerprint of the spec's exact content. It gives the TDD Agent and CI system certainty that a test was written against this exact version, not a silently edited one.

**Goals**
One to three sentences. What problem does this solve and for whom?

**Scope**
- In scope: explicit list of what this spec covers
- Out of scope: explicit list of what it does not cover — this prevents scope creep and ambiguity

**Requirements**
Numbered. Observable. Testable. No vague language.

Bad: "The system should be fast and handle errors gracefully."
Good:
- REQ-01: The invoice creation endpoint must return a response within 500ms at p99 under 100 concurrent requests.
- REQ-02: If the customer ID does not exist, the API must return HTTP 422 with error code `CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND`.

**Acceptance Criteria**
One or more per requirement. Format: Given / When / Then or plain testable statement.

- AC-01 (REQ-01): Given 100 concurrent POST /invoices requests, when measured over 60 seconds, then p99 latency ≤ 500ms.
- AC-02 (REQ-02): Given a POST /invoices with customerId "nonexistent-id", when the request is processed, then response is 422 with body `{"error": "CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND"}`.

**Invariants**
Conditions that must always hold, regardless of input or state. These become assertion sets in tests.

- INV-01: Invoice total must always equal sum of line item subtotals.
- INV-02: An invoice in status "paid" must never transition back to "pending".

**Edge Cases**
Concrete scenarios, not categories. "What happens when X?" not "Handle edge cases."

- EC-01: What happens when a line item has quantity 0?
- EC-02: What happens when the same invoice is submitted twice with identical idempotency key?
- EC-03: What happens when currency conversion rate is unavailable at invoice creation time?

**Dependencies**
External systems, APIs, or services this spec relies on.

**Open Questions**
Unresolved ambiguities that require human decision before TDD can proceed.

## Versioning and Hashing

Every time the spec changes:
1. Increment version (semantic: major for scope changes, minor for clarifications)
2. Update Last Edited timestamp (ISO-8601 UTC)
3. Recompute hash from canonical content

The hash is what the TDD Agent binds tests to. If the spec changes and the hash changes, all tests certified against the old hash are automatically flagged as stale by CI. This is the drift detection mechanism.

Canonical content for hashing: strip the metadata header, normalize whitespace, hash the rest.

## Code Examples Over Prose

For requirements involving interfaces, data shapes, or API contracts, a single code example communicates more precisely than paragraphs of description — and leaves less room for agent misinterpretation.

**Without example (ambiguous):**
> REQ-04: The invoice creation endpoint must accept a list of line items, each with a product ID, quantity, and unit price.

**With example (precise):**
> REQ-04: The invoice creation endpoint must accept a request body matching this shape:
> ```
> // Example in TypeScript — use your project's type system
> interface CreateInvoiceRequest {
>   customerId: string;
>   lineItems: Array<{
>     productId: string;
>     quantity: number;        // must be > 0
>     unitPriceInCents: number; // must be > 0
>   }>;
>   idempotencyKey: string;
> }
> ```

Include code examples when: the requirement defines an interface, a response shape, an event structure, a state machine, or any data contract. Skip them when a plain English requirement is unambiguous.

## Agent Directives (Optional)

For complex tasks, include task-specific agent boundary rules directly in the spec. These are different from global rules in AGENTS.md — they apply only to this spec.

```
## Agent Directives

✅ Always:
- Return errors using the standard envelope format from ADR-001: `{ "error": { "code": "...", "message": "..." } }`
- Use the existing CustomerRepository interface — do not add direct database queries

⚠️ Ask before:
- Adding new database columns (requires migration coordination)
- Changing the InvoiceCreated event shape (downstream consumers depend on it)

🚫 Never:
- Implement currency conversion in this feature — out of scope (EC-03)
- Send emails directly — use the NotificationService interface only
```

Use this section when the task has high-risk boundaries that aren't covered by the architecture ADR alone.

## Large Spec Strategy

For features that touch multiple domains or services, split into sub-specs rather than writing one long spec:

- `SPEC-012a`: Invoice creation (this service's behavior)
- `SPEC-012b`: Payment processing integration (the boundary contract)
- `SPEC-012c`: Email notification side effect

Each sub-spec gets its own hash and can be run through TDD independently. The parent spec references child IDs. This keeps individual specs focused and prevents attention degradation in the agents reading them.

## Quality Standards

A spec is ready when:
- Every requirement is observable (can be measured or verified)
- Every requirement has at least one acceptance criterion
- No acceptance criterion contains vague qualifiers ("fast", "robust", "intuitive", "appropriate")
- Invariants are explicit and minimal (only include what must never be violated)
- Edge cases are concrete scenarios, not categories
- Out-of-scope items are listed
- Open questions are listed (not silently assumed away)
- Metadata is complete and hash is current
- Code examples included for all interface and data shape requirements

## Common Failure Modes

**Vague language**: "The system should handle errors gracefully" — unverifiable. Replace with specific error codes, response shapes, and recovery behavior.

**Hidden assumptions**: "Obviously the user will be authenticated" — write it down. TDD and Programmer agents do not share your implicit knowledge.

**Missing scope boundaries**: Not stating what's out of scope invites agents to implement things you didn't want.

**Spec change without hash update**: The most dangerous failure. Tests keep passing against the old spec while the implementation drifts. Always recompute the hash.

**Narrative fluff**: Long prose paragraphs explaining context belong in project_notes.md. The spec should be dense with requirements, not background.

**Interface described in prose**: Any requirement describing a data shape, API contract, or interface that could be expressed as a typed definition or JSON example should be. Prose descriptions generate more interpretation variance across agents.

## What Belongs Where

| Content | Location |
|---|---|
| Requirements, acceptance criteria, invariants, edge cases | Spec file — default `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/specs/<NNN>-<feature-name>/` unless the user explicitly selects another durable project-owned location |
| Software Architecture decisions and pattern choices | ADR — see `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` |
| Project conventions and tribal knowledge | `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/project_memory.md` |
| Lessons learned from past mistakes | `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/learnings.md` |
| Open questions and parking lot items | `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/project_notes.md` |

## Strict Mode — Spec Package

In strict mode, a spec is a PACKAGE, not a single file. A feature that enters the delivery pipeline in strict mode must have all required files present and complete before any downstream agent (TDD,Software Architect, Programmer) is dispatched.

When the active provider is `speckit`, the authoritative AI Dev Shop-local contract is `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/speckit/compatibility.md`.

**Required files for a strict-mode spec package:**

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `feature.spec.md` | Core spec: goals, requirements, acceptance criteria, invariants, edge cases |
| `api.spec.md` | Typed API contracts: request/response shapes, error envelopes (TypeScript — use equivalent for other languages) |
| `state.spec.md` | State machine definitions, valid transitions, invariants expressed as types |
| `orchestrator.spec.md` | Orchestration contracts: what the coordinator/service layer receives, calls, and returns |
| `ui.spec.md` | UI component contracts: props, events, and observable behavior |
| `errors.spec.md` | All error types, codes, messages, and the conditions that produce them |
| `behavior.spec.md` | Behavioral narratives: end-to-end user journeys and system behavior in plain language |
| `traceability.spec.md` | Requirement-to-test mapping: each REQ/AC traced to the test(s) that verify it |
| `spec-manifest.md` | Package index: actual filenames, omitted files, stage read set, and naming convention |
| `spec-dod.md` | Definition-of-Done checklist with evidence (not just checked boxes) |

**DoD checklist requirement**: Each item in `spec-dod.md` must include evidence of completion — a reference to the specific requirement, test name, or artifact that satisfies it. Checked boxes with no evidence are not accepted.

**Banned vague language**: The following phrases are banned in strict-mode spec packages unless followed immediately by a measurable criterion:
- "should work" — replace with a specific observable outcome
- "remains unchanged" — replace with what specifically must not change and how it is verified
- "consumer model only" — replace with the exact consumer constraints
- "as needed" — replace with the specific condition that triggers the need
- "appropriate" — replace with the specific standard or threshold that defines appropriate

Example of banned usage: "The system should handle errors appropriately."
Example of compliant usage: "The system must return HTTP 422 with body `{ error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', field: 'quantity', message: 'must be > 0' } }` when quantity is zero or negative."

**Implementation-readiness test**: Before a strict-mode spec package is approved, apply this test: can a competent developer who has never seen this project implement the feature from these spec files alone, without asking any clarifying questions? If the answer is no — because something is missing, ambiguous, or requires assumed context — the spec is not done.

**Reference**: `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/quality/spec-definition-of-done.md` is the authoritative checklist template for strict-mode spec packages.

**Mechanical validation**: run `python3 <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/speckit/validators/validate_spec_package.py <spec-folder> --phase spec --update-hash` before handoff. Treat any non-zero exit code as a blocking failure. Use the spec package directory, not the `feature.spec.md` file path. If `python3` is unavailable, try `python` or `py`; if the validator runtime is still unavailable, stop unless a human approves a single-line `validator_manual_waiver` in `pipeline-state.md` with reviewer, timestamp, reason, and manual checks performed.

## Brownfield / Legacy Code Rule

When writing a spec for a new feature in a codebase that already exists, apply these rules without exception. Ignoring them produces "SpecFall" — an undeliverable attempt to comprehensively document a legacy system before any new work can begin.

**Rule 1 — Narrow scope to the new feature and its immediate integration boundaries only.**
The spec covers what is being built and the exact points where it touches existing code. It does not cover anything the existing system already does that is not being changed. If the new feature calls an existing `UserRepository.findById()` method, the spec references that method by name — it does not describe what `findById` does.

**Rule 2 — Treat existing codebase patterns as constraints, not subjects.**
Existing naming conventions, error formats, authentication patterns, and data shapes are inputs the new feature must conform to. They belong in the spec's Constraints or Agent Directives section as one-line references, not as requirements to be re-specified. Example: `"Errors must use the existing envelope format from error-types.ts"` — not a full redefinition of the error format.

**Rule 3 — Reference legacy behavior by citation, never by restatement.**
If the new feature has a boundary with legacy code, name the existing file, function, or interface it integrates with. Do not copy-paste or paraphrase what that code does. The Programmer Agent can read the existing code. Restating it creates a second source of truth that will drift.

**Rule 4 — Explicitly list legacy areas that are out of scope.**
The Out of Scope section must name adjacent legacy modules that are not being changed, even if they are related. This prevents agents from expanding work into unrelated parts of the codebase under the assumption that "while we're here" improvements are in scope.

**Rule 5 — Preserve evidence instead of normalizing it away.**
If the spec is derived from CodeBase Analyzer or reverse-spec artifacts, cite the
report paths and preserve evidence/confidence metadata needed by downstream
agents. A normalized provider spec may rewrite requirement text, but it must not
drop source evidence, confidence labels, preservation decisions, coverage
status, consumer compatibility notes, or intentional-change approvals.

**Reverse-spec checkpoint**: Do not recommend `/plan` for a reverse-spec-derived
spec until the human has reviewed `review-digest.md`, approved or revised
`intentional-changes.md`, and resolved blocking items in `coverage-map.md` or
the review digest. Record the result in `pipeline-state.md` as
`reverse_spec_review_status`.

**Failure mode to avoid**: A spec that starts with "The existing system currently does X, Y, and Z..." is already in SpecFall. Stop. Delete everything before the first REQ line and start with the new feature's requirements only.

## Spec Placement and File Selection

### Placement

Specs go where the user specifies. Ask if not specified. Always create a named subfolder at the target location — never write spec files flat. Name the subfolder after the feature or source file.

Example: user says "create specs for `data.py` in `__specs__`" →

```
pytorch/
├── data.py
└── __specs__/
    └── data/
        ├── feature.spec.md
        ├── behavior.spec.md
        └── spec-manifest.md
```

### Applicability Assessment

Before writing any file, assess what the target (feature or source file) actually contains. Only produce what applies:

| Target contains | Produce |
|---|---|
| Any domain logic, functions, or classes | `feature.spec.md` — always |
| Non-trivial ordering, branching, or state machine | `behavior.spec.md` |
| API endpoints or HTTP handlers | `api.spec.md` |
| State management or data store logic | `state.spec.md` |
| Orchestrator / coordinator / hook layer | `orchestrator.spec.md` |
| UI components | `ui.spec.md` |
| Error definitions or structured error handling | `errors.spec.md` |
| REQ-to-function traceability needed | `traceability.spec.md` |

Always include `spec-manifest.md` documenting what was produced and what was omitted with justification.

### Speccing Existing Code

When creating specs for existing code, write requirements from the observable behavior — what the code *does*, not what you wish it did. If the code has bugs or design problems, note them in a `## Known Issues` section rather than speccing desired behavior as if it exists. Reference other files by name — do not restate what they do.

## Writing Sharp Requirements

**Reframe instructions as success criteria.** Vague requirements ("make it faster", "improve the UX") must be translated into measurable criteria ("LCP < 2.5s on 4G", "task completion rate > 85%") before a spec can be written. Always confirm the reframed criteria with the user before proceeding.

## Spec Change Protocol

When requirements change mid-development:
1. Update the spec with new version and hash
2. Notify Coordinator
3. Coordinator routes back to TDD Agent to recertify tests against new hash
4. Programmer Agent is not dispatched until tests are recertified
5. CI must validate hash alignment before any merge

Human review is required at spec approval and at any major scope change.
