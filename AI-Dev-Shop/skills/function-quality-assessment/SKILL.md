# Skill: Function Quality Assessment

Apply this skill to every new or materially changed logic-bearing function.

This skill has two distinct jobs: a pre-coding Design Gate and a post-coding
Assessment Gate. It does not replace the source skills below; it turns their
rules into a per-function assessment with `@overallScore`, severity findings,
fix-before-handoff behavior, and review reporting.

Use it in two distinct modes:

- **Design Gate (before coding):** shape the function correctly from the start.
  This gate blocks coding when boundaries, seams, contracts, or scale risks are
  still implicit. Do not assign `@overallScore`, severity findings, or pass/debt
  status here.
- **Assessment Gate (after coding):** score the result, catch gaps, and decide
  whether the change can be handed off. This is the first stage where scoring,
  debt-band routing, and block/pass classification apply.

## Design Gate

The Design Gate passes only when the current slice has an explicit function job,
signature shape, test seam, effect boundary, complexity/resource view, and any
required aggregate-risk note that another agent could implement or review
without guessing.

## Writing Posture

When writing a logic-bearing function:

1. Give the function one clear job. Keep validation, business rules, and
   orchestration separate unless the existing boundary is intentionally broader.
2. Prefer pure functions for rules, calculations, and transformations. Keep
   side effects at explicit boundaries.
3. Do not mutate input objects unless an in-place contract is required by the
   existing API and documented clearly.
4. Make important dependencies explicit. Do not hide behavior behind module
   state, environment reads, clocks, randomness, caches, or feature flags
   unless that dependency is intentional, controlled, and testable.
5. For exported or boundary functions, default to a required input object as
   the first parameter and an optional options object as the second parameter,
   unless compatibility or language convention justifies another shape.
6. Keep return shapes and error behavior stable. Do not mix unrelated failure
   signals such as booleans, strings, `null`, and thrown errors for the same
   kind of problem.
7. Decide the test seam before coding. If the function cannot be tested with
   direct inputs and direct assertions, redesign the boundary first.
8. Think about scale before coding. Identify complexity, query or I/O shape,
   resource bounds, idempotency needs, and concurrency risks for caller-
   controlled or unbounded input.
9. For rule, validation, batch, reducer, or cross-record workflows, name at
   least one aggregate or adversarial edge case before coding and add coverage
   for it before handoff.

## Source Skills

Use these as the source of truth for definitions:

- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/coding-foundations/SKILL.md` — explicit dependencies, pure-by-default decisions, effect boundaries, stable contracts, fail-fast defaults, and small readable units
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/testable-design-patterns/SKILL.md` — two-object exported signatures, typed contracts, coverage-friendly branch design, test seams, typed error paths, and test anti-pattern bans
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/implementation-guardrails/SKILL.md` — complexity, scale, query shape, resource bounds, per-item I/O, and tradeoff notes
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/inline-code-documentation/SKILL.md` — language-idiomatic function documentation format

Use this companion when the workflow has aggregate or cross-item risk:

- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/adversarial-test-design/SKILL.md` — adversarial cases, invariants, property-test fit, and direct-probe selection for workflows that can fail only across multiple records, retries, ordering changes, or partial failures

If this skill appears to conflict with a source skill, keep the source skill's
definition and use this skill only to score, report, and route the result.

## Ownership

- Programmer applies this skill before and after implementation, fixes locally
  fixable findings, and documents the final function score.
- Code Review validates the Programmer's assessment independently and records a
  Function Quality Assessment section in the saved code review report.
- Refactor uses failed assessment findings as targeted cleanup input.
- Coordinator sees only the routing summary: score, status, Critical/High count,
  blocked flag, and suggested next route.

## Scope

Assess:

- exported functions and public module boundaries
- workflow, orchestration, adapter, rule, validation, and transformation functions
- local helpers with meaningful branching, business logic, I/O, error handling,
  complexity, or reuse pressure

Tiny local helpers may be covered by the closest parent assessment when a full
comment would add noise. Do not use that exception for code that is hard to
test, hard to scale, security-sensitive, or likely to be reused.

Use assessment units, not raw function count. A tiny private helper may inherit
the nearest assessed parent only when it has no meaningful branching, I/O, error
handling, scale risk, security/privacy risk, or independent reuse pressure. If a
helper owns a rule, policy decision, data transformation, effect, error contract,
or complexity tradeoff, assess it directly.

## Programmer Procedure

Before coding a logic-bearing function (Design Gate):

1. State the function's single job and why it is the right boundary for the
   current slice.
2. Identify the function's required input object and optional options object,
   unless existing API compatibility or language convention justifies another
   shape.
3. Identify the test seam and expected assertions.
4. Decide whether the function should be pure decision logic or an explicit
   effect boundary.
5. Identify time complexity, space complexity, query/I/O shape, and resource
   bounds for caller-controlled or unbounded input.
6. If the workflow depends on multiple records, rules, retries, or ordering,
   activate `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/adversarial-test-design/SKILL.md` and
   name at least one invariant or adversarial case before coding.

After coding (Assessment Gate):

1. This is the first point where `@overallScore`, severity findings, and
   pass/debt/block routing apply.
2. Apply the checklist in `references/checklist.md` to each assessment unit.
3. Refactor locally fixable findings before handoff.
4. Add or update language-idiomatic function documentation.
5. Include time and space complexity.
6. Include `@tradeoffs` or the language-equivalent section only when the
   tradeoff is meaningful.
7. Include `@overallScore`.
8. Include severity-graded findings when the score is below 100.
9. For rule engines, validators, batch processors, reducers, reconciliation
   logic, or any workflow where behavior depends on multiple records, add at
   least one adversarial aggregate/cross-item test or direct probe.
10. If a non-trivial change has every assessed unit at `100/100`, run a score
    skepticism pass before handoff. Re-check requirements, edge cases, scale,
    hidden dependencies, error paths, and test coverage. If every score remains
    `100/100`, state why in the handoff.
11. Report coverage metrics when a local coverage command is available. If
    coverage cannot be measured, say why and identify the direct tests that
    cover each assessed unit.

## Code Review Procedure

For every new or materially changed function in scope:

1. Confirm the Programmer assessment exists when required.
2. Confirm the Programmer handoff includes the compact assessment table.
3. Re-assess the function using the same checklist.
4. Validate that `@overallScore` is plausible.
5. Flag missing, inflated, or inconsistent scores.
6. For non-trivial changes where every score is `100/100`, verify that the
   Programmer performed and documented the score skepticism pass.
7. Check whether tiny helpers were over-documented or under-assessed. Treat
   over-documentation as Recommended cleanup unless it hides a required finding.
8. For rule, validation, batch, or reducer workflows, confirm at least one
   adversarial aggregate/cross-item behavior test or probe exists.
9. Classify findings using the thresholds below.
10. Add a Function Quality Assessment section to the saved code review report at
   `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/code-review/CR-<feature-id>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`.

Do not create a separate function-quality report by default. Code Review already
owns the retained review artifact; this assessment belongs inside that report.

## Scoring And Blocking

Use `references/scoring-rubric.md` as the canonical scoring rubric.

- `Critical` finding: hard block regardless of score.
- `< 80`: hard block.
- `80-89`: Programmer must attempt one local fix cycle. If still `80-89`, handoff
  may proceed only with documented tech debt, smallest compliant refactor, and
  Coordinator notification. The fix cycle must include concrete evidence:
  changed structure in the diff, a progress-ledger entry, or a handoff-table note
  naming the attempted extraction/restructuring/decomposition. Comments-only,
  formatting-only, or rename-only changes do not satisfy this requirement.
- `90-99`: pass with findings.
- `100`: clean pass.

Code Review may upgrade any unresolved `High` finding to Required when it is
likely to cause production failure, security exposure, scale failure, or
coverage-hostile design.
Code Review must upgrade an `80-89` debt-band handoff to Required when the
Programmer claims a local fix cycle but provides no structural evidence for it.

## Report Shape

Programmer handoff Style Notes must include:

- a compact function-quality table:
  `function | score | Critical/High count | below-100 reason | local fix attempted`
- score skepticism result when every assessed unit is `100/100` in a non-trivial
  change
- assessed functions with `@overallScore` below 100
- Critical/High finding count
- any score below 90 after the local fix cycle
- justified deviations from the two-object parameter convention
- adversarial aggregate/cross-item tests or probes added for rule, validation,
  batch, or reducer workflows
- coverage metrics, or the reason coverage could not be measured
- remaining complexity, scale, I/O, determinism, concurrency, security, or
  extensibility risks

Code Review report must include:

```text
