# Sensor: Mutation Quality

Grades test effectiveness by deliberately injecting faults into modified code and checking whether the test suite detects them. A test that passes after code is broken is not protecting anything.

## Sensor Definition

- **Class**: `computational`
- **Timing**: PR (after green suite confirmation) + scheduled (release gate, full-scope)
- **Owner**: TestRunner triggers → Observer tracks trends → routes to TDD agent or Programmer
- **Artifact location**: `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/sensors/mutation-quality-<timestamp>.md`

## Tools by Stack

Resolved from the `mutation_tests` slot in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/contracts/computational-controls.md`. If no slot is declared, this sensor is inactive (advisory note only).

| Stack | Mutation tool | Typical command |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| TypeScript/JavaScript | Stryker | `npx stryker run --mutate '{touched_files}'` |
| Python | mutmut | `mutmut run --paths-to-mutate={touched_files}` |
| Go | go-mutesting | `go-mutesting {touched_packages}` |
| Java/Kotlin | PIT | `mvn org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage -DtargetClasses={touched_classes}` |
| Generic | project-specific | declared in computational controls |

**Placeholder replacement rules:**
- `{touched_files}` — space-separated file paths of modified source files that have corresponding tests (comma-separated glob for Stryker)
- `{touched_packages}` — Go package paths containing modified files (e.g., `./pkg/auth/...`)
- `{touched_classes}` — fully qualified class names for modified Java/Kotlin source files (e.g., `com.example.auth.*`)

The actual command and placeholder used is declared per-project in the `mutation_tests` slot of computational controls.

## Scope Policy

### PR Context (default)

Mutate only files modified in the current work:
- Source files touched by the PR/feature that have corresponding tests
- Exclude generated code, config files, type declarations, and vendored dependencies
- Scope expansion to direct callers: if a touched file's public API changed, include one level of direct importers when the mutation tool supports it and timeout permits

### Scheduled Context (release gate)

Full module or package mutation run. Expensive — run on CI with extended timeout, not in interactive pipeline.

## Threshold Policy

Mutation testing thresholds are progressive, not absolute from day one.

### Baseline Establishment

On first run for a project:
1. Record the initial mutation score per module as the baseline
2. No enforcement on the first run — advisory only
3. Baseline is stored in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/sensors/mutation-baseline.json`

### Ongoing Enforcement

When multiple conditions match simultaneously, apply the most severe gate behavior (Hard Blocker > Escalation > Advisory > Pass).

| Condition | Gate Behavior |
|-----------|--------------|
| Mutation score on touched files drops >10% vs baseline | **Hard Blocker** — regression detected |
| Mutation score on touched files is below the ratcheted module floor | **Escalation** — slipped below established quality |
| Mutation score on touched files is below 60% (absolute floor) | **Escalation** — weak tests on modified code |
| Mutation score on touched files is >=60% and <70% | **Advisory** — improvement recommended |
| Mutation score on touched files is >=70% with regression >0% and <=10% | **Advisory** — minor regression noted |
| Mutation score on touched files is >=70% with no regression or improvement | **Pass** |
| Mutation tool is not declared in computational controls | **Advisory** — sensor inactive, logged |
| Mutation run times out | **Escalation** — inconclusive, cannot gate |
| Mutation tool errors or unsupported stack | **Advisory** — sensor degraded |

### Threshold Ratchet

Once a module's mutation score reaches 80%+, the baseline ratchets up. The new floor for that module becomes `current_score - 5%`. Falling below this ratcheted floor triggers an Escalation. This prevents score backsliding after investment in test quality.

## Timeout Policy

Mutation testing is expensive. The sensor enforces a timeout to prevent pipeline stalls.

- **PR context**: default 180 seconds per mutated file, max 600 seconds total for the mutation pass
- **Scheduled context**: default 3600 seconds (1 hour) for full runs
- If timeout is reached: kill the process, report partial results, classify as **Escalation** (inconclusive)
- Projects may override timeouts in the `mutation_tests` slot of computational controls

## What This Sensor Measures

- **Mutation score**: percentage of injected mutants killed by the test suite
- **Survived mutants**: list of mutations that tests did NOT catch (these are real coverage gaps)
- **Equivalent mutants**: mutations that don't change observable behavior (excluded from score)
- **Timeout mutants**: mutations where tests hung (counted as killed — the test noticed something)
- **Per-file mutation scores**: for each touched file, individual score and survived mutant details

## Output Format

The sensor produces a structured artifact:

```
## Mutation Quality Report — <feature-id> — <timestamp>

### Summary
- Scope: touched files only / full module
- Files mutated: <count>
- Total mutants: <count>
- Killed: <count> (<pct>%)
- Survived: <count> (<pct>%)
- Timeout: <count>
- Equivalent (excluded): <count>
- Overall mutation score: <pct>%
- Baseline score: <pct>%
- Delta: <+/- pct>%
- Gate result: PASS / ADVISORY / ESCALATION / HARD_BLOCKER

### Per-File Results
| File | Mutants | Killed | Survived | Score | Baseline | Delta | Status |
|------|---------|--------|----------|-------|----------|-------|--------|

### Survived Mutants (Top Priority)
For each survived mutant:
- File and line
- Mutation type (e.g., boundary change, removed call, negated condition)
- What the test suite should have caught
- Suggested test approach

### Gate Decision
<PASS|ADVISORY|ESCALATION|HARD_BLOCKER> — <rationale>
```

## Action-on-Fail

| Finding | Severity | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Score regression >10% on touched files | Hard Blocker | Pipeline stops; TDD or Programmer must add tests for survived mutants |
| Score below ratcheted module floor | Escalation | Coordinator warns; Programmer asked to restore quality to historical levels |
| Score below 60% on touched files | Escalation | Coordinator warns; Programmer asked to improve tests before Code Review |
| Score 60-70% on touched files | Advisory | Noted in handoff; Code Review informed |
| Score >=70% with minor regression (>0% and <=10%) | Advisory | Noted in handoff; Code Review informed of minor regression |
| Mutation tool timeout (inconclusive) | Escalation | Coordinator decides: retry with narrower scope, defer to scheduled run, or waive |
| Survived mutants in critical-path code | Escalation | Even if overall score is above threshold, specific survived mutants in auth/payment/data-integrity paths escalate |

## Routing

1. **PR context (triggered by TestRunner)**:
   - TestRunner runs mutation pass after all suites are green and coverage is evaluated
   - Mutation results included in TestRunner's run report
   - Gate failures route back to Programmer (add tests) or TDD (redesign test approach)
   - Results forwarded to Code Review as evidence for test quality dimension

2. **Scheduled context (Observer)**:
   - Observer runs full-module mutation analysis weekly or at release gates
   - Trends tracked in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/sensors/mutation-trends.json`
   - Sustained low scores → tech debt entry
   - Routes to TDD agent for test-plan recommendations

3. **Interaction with coverage sensor**:
   - Coverage answers "what lines are executed by tests?"
   - Mutation answers "would tests catch a bug on those lines?"
   - A file can have 100% coverage and 30% mutation score (tests execute code but don't assert on results)
   - Both sensors together give the full picture of test effectiveness

## Interaction with Audit Subagent

When `/audit-work` spawns an internal verification subagent:
- Mutation quality results are included in the subagent's evidence packet
- A low mutation score on touched files raises the severity weight for findings about test adequacy
- The subagent may cite survived mutants as evidence that claimed correctness lacks verification

## What This Does NOT Cover

- Test design quality (whether tests check the right things conceptually — that's Code Review dimension 3)
- Integration/E2E mutation (only unit/integration source mutations in phase 1)
- Performance impact of code mutations
- Security-specific fault injection (that's Red Team territory)
