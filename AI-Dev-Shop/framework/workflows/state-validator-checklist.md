# State & Schema Validator Checklist

A quick sanity-check for humans before resuming a pipeline run or reviewing memory entries. Run this when: resuming an interrupted run, onboarding to an in-progress feature, or auditing memory quality.

---

## 1. Pipeline State File (`pipeline-state.md`)

Located at the active feature's canonical pipeline folder, usually: `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/pipeline-state.md`

### Required fields
- [ ] `run_id` is present and non-empty
- [ ] `spec_provider` is present, or the run is explicitly documented as legacy Speckit compatibility mode
- [ ] `spec_hash` is present — re-hash `spec_entrypoint_path` and confirm it matches
- [ ] `spec_entrypoint_path` is present and readable
- [ ] `spec_readiness_artifact` is present and readable
- [ ] `validator_result` is `PASS`, or single-line `validator_manual_waiver` includes reviewer, timestamp, reason, and manual checks because the validator runtime was unavailable after documented binary fallbacks were tried
- [ ] `planning_preflight_status` is `PASS` before any resume at or after `architect`
- [ ] `planning_preflight_spec_hash` matches current `spec_hash`
- [ ] `red_team_status` is `PASS` or `ADVISORY_ONLY` before Software Architect dispatch/resume
- [ ] `red_team_spec_hash` matches current `spec_hash`
- [ ] If `system_blueprint_path` is set, `system_blueprint_status` is `APPROVED`
- [ ] If `reverse_spec_artifacts` is set, `reverse_spec_review_status` is `APPROVED` and `review-digest.md` exists
- [ ] If `codebase_analysis_reports` is set, every referenced ANALYSIS/MIGRATION/TESTABILITY file exists
- [ ] `current_stage` is a valid stage name (see `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/pipeline-state-format.md`)
- [ ] `status` is one of: `IN_PROGRESS` | `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN` | `COMPLETE` | `FAILED` | `CANCELLED` | `ABORTED`
- [ ] `last_updated_at` timestamp is recent (if stale by days, the run may have been abandoned)
- [ ] If `progress_ledger_path` is present, the file exists and is readable
- [ ] If the progress ledger references offloaded evidence, those offload paths also exist

### Completed stages
- [ ] Every file listed in the Completed Stages table actually exists on disk
- [ ] Output hashes are present for each completed stage (not blank)

### Human checkpoints
- [ ] Checkboxes reflect what was actually approved — no unchecked box for a stage that's already past
- [ ] If reverse-spec artifacts fed the spec, the review digest approval checkbox is marked before Software Architect
- [ ] If a system blueprint was produced, its approval checkbox is marked before Spec approval
- [ ] Red-Team clearance is marked before Software Architect
- [ ] If `architect` stage is complete, the Constitution Check sign-off checkbox is marked

### Current stage detail
- [ ] `job_status` is a valid state: `QUEUED` | `DISPATCHED` | `RUNNING` | `RETRYING` | `DONE` | `FAILED` | `ESCALATED` | `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN` | `CANCELLED` | `ABORTED`
- [ ] If `job_status` is `RETRYING`, `retry_count` is present and within the stage's budget
- [ ] If `retry_count` is 2 or more, `current_hypothesis` is present and specific
- [ ] If `job_status` is `ABORTED`, treat as resumable — follow `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/recovery-playbook.md`
- [ ] If `job_status` is `CANCELLED`, do not resume — start a new run

### Failure clusters
- [ ] Each cluster row has a `First Seen` date and `Retry Count`
- [ ] No cluster has retry count above its stage budget without an escalation note
- [ ] If a cluster is retry-heavy, the progress ledger records a next different approach instead of repeating the same hypothesis

---

## 2. Memory Store Entries (`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/memory-store.md`)

Run this when reviewing entries written by the Observer, or when a human is promoting Observer recommendations to agent skills.md files.

### Per-entry checks
- [ ] `entry_id` is present and follows format: `TYPE-YYYYMMDD-NNN` (e.g. `FAILURE-20260222-001`)
- [ ] `date` is a valid ISO-8601 timestamp
- [ ] `tags` are present and use `#lowercase-hyphenated` format
- [ ] If `supersedes` references another entry_id, that entry exists in the file
- [ ] If `expires_at` is set, check whether the entry has expired — expired entries should be excluded from injection

### FAILURE entries
- [ ] `root_cause` is one sentence, specific enough to be actionable
- [ ] `resolution` is present if `resolved_by` is set (unresolved failures are OK if still open)
- [ ] `occurrences` count is accurate

### DECISION entries
- [ ] `decision` field is a single declarative sentence (not a question, not "we might")
- [ ] `rationale` explains why the alternative was not chosen
- [ ] If category is `constitution`, an ADR reference is present

### CONSTITUTION entries
- [ ] `article` field matches one of Articles I–VIII
- [ ] `status` is one of: `COMPLIES` | `EXCEPTION` | `VIOLATION`
- [ ] If `EXCEPTION`, `justification` explains what was granted and why

### FACT entries
- [ ] `content` is specific — not "check the docs" but the actual fact
- [ ] `expires_at` is set if the fact is time-sensitive (e.g. an API version that will change)

## 3. Quick Resume Decision

After running the above checks:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| All checks pass, status `IN_PROGRESS` | Resume from `current_stage` per recovery playbook |
| Spec hash mismatch | Stop — escalate to human before resuming |
| Planning preflight is missing or failed at/after Software Architect | Stop — rerun Coordinator Planning Preflight and route to the owning failed stage |
| Red-Team missing before Software Architect | Stop — run Red-Team against the current spec hash |
| Reverse-spec review not approved before Software Architect | Stop — present `review-digest.md` to the human |
| Missing artifact for completed stage | Re-run that stage, then continue |
| Constitution Check missing on completed `architect` stage | Re-run architect stage |
| `job_status` is `ABORTED` | Resume per recovery playbook |
| `job_status` is `CANCELLED` | Do not resume — start fresh |
| `job_status` is `FAILED` | Do not resume — start fresh, reference Notes for context |
| Status is `COMPLETE` | Do not resume — pipeline finished |
