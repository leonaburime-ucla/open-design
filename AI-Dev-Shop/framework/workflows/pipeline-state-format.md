# Pipeline State Format

Every pipeline run writes a `pipeline-state.md` file to the active feature's canonical pipeline folder in the project-owned sibling workspace. The Coordinator reads this file at the start of every session to detect and resume incomplete runs.

**Location:** `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/pipeline-state.md`

Status and confidence labels follow
`<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/status-confidence-taxonomy.md`. Pipeline
state records routing consequences; it does not translate source evidence labels
into different confidence systems.

Legacy note: older runs may still use `.pipeline-state.md`. Treat that as the previous filename and migrate it to `pipeline-state.md` when the run is next resumed or updated.

## Parallel Task Tracking

|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|------------|--------------|--------|
| T008 | TDD | `tests/...` | QUEUED | N/A | N/A | T010 |

Only the Coordinator updates task status and checkboxes in `tasks.md`.
Specialist agents may report task progress in handoffs, but do not mutate this
table unless explicitly delegated. Parallel tasks must have non-overlapping
write scopes; if a shared utility, test-certification record, coverage artifact,
or state file needs updates, serialize that update through the Coordinator or a
single owner.

## Iteration Counts

## Field Reference

### `progress_ledger_path` (required for resumable or long-running work)

```markdown
progress_ledger_path: <ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/progress-ledger.md
```

Points to the human/agent-readable resume surface defined in `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/runtime/session-continuity.md`.

- Required when work is expected to cross sessions, handoffs, or retry-heavy loops
- Recommended for any feature that reaches programmer retry 2+
- If absent on a resumable run, the Coordinator should create it before further dispatch

### `coordinator_mode` (required)

```
coordinator_mode: review | pipeline | direct
```

Tracks the Coordinator's current operating mode:
- `pipeline` — full multi-agent pipeline is active; jobs are created and tracked
- `review` — Coordinator is reviewing artifacts or answering questions; no jobs are created
- `direct` — user is working directly with a single agent; in-progress jobs are set to WAITING_FOR_HUMAN, not cancelled

### `debug_mode` (optional, default: off)

```
debug_mode: on | off
```

When `on`, the Observer emits `[DEBUG]` trace entries at every dispatch, gate check, and mode switch. Does not affect job state or pipeline logic — controls trace verbosity only.

### `spec_provider` (required for new runs)

```markdown
spec_provider: speckit | openspec | bmad | other
```

Records which upstream planning provider owns the spec surface for this run.

Legacy runs may omit this field. In that case, treat the run as Speckit compatibility mode unless a human says otherwise.

### `provider_native_root` and `provider_output_root` (required for new runs)

```markdown
provider_native_root: <upstream-native conceptual root>
provider_output_root: <actual durable output root>
```

- `provider_native_root` records the upstream provider's conceptual surface, such as `specs/`, `openspec/`, or `_bmad-output/`
- `provider_output_root` records the actual path AI Dev Shop wrote for this run; the default root is under `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/specs/`
- downstream agents must use recorded actual paths, not infer write targets from upstream-native examples

### `spec_entrypoint_path` and `spec_readiness_artifact` (required for new runs)

```markdown
spec_entrypoint_path: <provider-defined requirements entrypoint>
spec_readiness_artifact: <provider-defined readiness artifact>
```

- `spec_entrypoint_path` is the file used for drift detection and resume hashing
- `spec_readiness_artifact` is the file or artifact used to prove the planning surface is ready for architecture work
- for the default Speckit provider, these typically map to `feature.spec.md` and `spec-dod.md`
- new AI Dev Shop runs should normally place these paths under `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/specs/`

### Planning preflight fields (required before Software Architect dispatch)

```markdown
planning_preflight_status: NOT_RUN | PASS | FAIL
planning_preflight_checked_at: <ISO-8601 UTC or N/A>
planning_preflight_spec_hash: <sha256 or N/A>
planning_preflight_failures: <summary or N/A>
```

The Coordinator writes these fields when `/plan`, manual Software Architect dispatch, or
resume validation reaches the architecture boundary. `PASS` means provider
readiness, hash verification, human approval, Red-Team clearance, blueprint
status, reverse-spec review, and brownfield evidence wiring have all passed for
the same spec hash.

Preflight relies on the primary provider validator and Red-Team fields for
validator and adversarial-review status. Do not duplicate those values into
separate preflight-specific status fields.

### Validator waiver fields (allowed only when the validator runtime is unavailable)

```markdown
validator_result: PASS | FAIL | NOT_RUN
validator_manual_waiver: reviewer=<name>; timestamp=<ISO-8601 UTC>; reason=<why runtime unavailable>; manual_checks=<checks performed>
```

Provider-local validators are mandatory before Software Architect dispatch. A manual
waiver is not a substitute for fixing a failing validator; it exists only when
the required runtime cannot be executed in the host environment. The waiver must
stay on one line using semicolon-separated fields so state parsers do not split
or drop waiver evidence.

### Brownfield and reverse-spec fields

```markdown
system_blueprint_path: <path or N/A>
system_blueprint_status: NOT_RUN | DRAFT | APPROVED | REVISE | N/A
codebase_analysis_reports: <ANALYSIS/MIGRATION/TESTABILITY paths or N/A>
reverse_spec_artifacts: <merged requirements, review digest, manifest, coverage map, consumer inventory, intentional changes, characterization tests, or N/A>
reverse_spec_review_status: NOT_APPLICABLE | PENDING | APPROVED | REVISE
```

Existing-codebase features and rewrites use these fields so Coordinator can
prove the Software Architect saw the sampled codebase evidence and any reverse-spec
human checkpoint before architecture decisions are made.

### Verification and review gate fields

```markdown
tasks_artifact: <path or N/A>
test_certification_artifact: <path or N/A>
test_certification_hash: <sha256 or N/A>
verification_packet_artifact: <path or N/A>
verification_packet_hash: <sha256 or N/A>
test_file_hash_status: NOT_RUN | PASS | FAIL | N/A
latest_testrunner_report: <path or N/A>
testrunner_status: NOT_RUN | PASS | FAIL | UNAVAILABLE | BLOCKED
executed_test_count: <integer or N/A>
expected_test_count: <integer or N/A>
required_suite_status: PASS | FAIL | PARTIAL | N/A
coverage_status: NOT_RUN | PASS | FAIL | UNAVAILABLE | N/A
flaky_test_status: NONE | KNOWN_APPROVED | UNAPPROVED | N/A
code_review_gate_status: NOT_READY | READY | WAIVED
```

The Coordinator updates these fields after accepting TDD and TestRunner outputs.
`code_review_gate_status` may be `READY` only when the Coordinator verification
packet is PASS for the active spec hash, certified test-file hashes match,
executed tests are greater than zero and meet/exceed the certified expected
count, required suites and coverage gates pass or are explicitly N/A, and no
unapproved flaky tests remain. A waiver must name the human reviewer, timestamp,
scope, reason, and remaining risk in Notes.

## Stages (Valid Values for `current_stage`)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `spec` | Spec Agent writing or revising spec |
| `clarify` | Spec Agent resolving [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers |
| `architect` | Software Architect Agent producing research.md + ADR |
| `tasks` | Coordinator generating tasks.md |
| `tdd` | TDD Agent writing and certifying tests |
| `programmer` | Programmer Agent implementing |
| `qa-e2e` | QA/E2E Agent writing browser tests |
| `testrunner` | TestRunner Agent verifying pass rate |
| `code-review` | Code Review Agent classifying findings |
| `security` | Security Agent reviewing threat surface |
| `devops` | DevOps Agent producing IaC/CI/deployment configs |
| `docs` | Docs Agent generating user-facing documentation |
| `refactor` | Refactor Agent proposing improvements |
| `done` | Pipeline complete, artifacts shipped |

---

## Write Rules

- The Coordinator writes or updates `pipeline-state.md` at every stage transition.
- Keep `progress_ledger_path` current when a progress ledger exists.
- Update `current_hypothesis` whenever a retry changes approach.
- After each human checkpoint is cleared, mark the corresponding checkbox.
- Never delete a completed stage row — append only.
- On FAILED status, write the failure reason to Notes before stopping.

---

## Read Rules

- At session start, the Coordinator checks for `pipeline-state.md` in the active feature folder under `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/`.
- If found and status is `IN_PROGRESS` or `WAITING_FOR_HUMAN`, follow the Recovery Playbook (`<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/recovery-playbook.md`).
- If found and status is `ABORTED`, treat as resumable — follow the Recovery Playbook.
- If `progress_ledger_path` is present, read the ledger before resuming or retrying.
- If the ledger references offloaded evidence files, verify they still exist before resuming.
- If found and status is `COMPLETE`, `FAILED`, or `CANCELLED`, do not resume — start a new run or treat as reference only.
- If not found, create a new one at the start of the spec stage.
