# Multi-Agent Pipeline

---

## Path Convention

All project-owned pipeline artifacts are written under `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>` — the sibling `ADS-project-knowledge/` folder next to the toolkit by default. `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>` remains the toolkit source tree.

- Provider-native forward specs and planning artifacts → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/specs/` by default (only use another durable project-owned location when the user explicitly asks; active provider and entrypoint paths are recorded in pipeline state)
- Pipeline artifacts (ADR, research, implementation outline, tasks,
  red-team findings, test certification, verification packet, pipeline state)
  → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/`
- Reports (analysis, test runs, code review, security) → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/` subfolders
- Local scratch, raw captures, exploratory prompts, and disposable session evidence → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/`
- Live project memory → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/`
- Live constitution → `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/constitution.md`
- **Read-only toolkit source:** `agents/`, `skills/`, `framework/spec-providers/`, `framework/templates/`, `framework/workflows/`, `framework/slash-commands/`, and the repo-local `project-knowledge-template/` workspace template

Artifact-intent rule:
- pipeline-required artifacts save directly to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/`
- optional retained reports ask before becoming canonical
- session-only scratch defaults to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/`

---

## Full Path (Existing Codebase)

```
[CodeBase Analyzer] → [System Design] → Spec → [Red-Team] → Software Architect → [Database] → TDD → Programmer → [QA/E2E] → TestRunner → Code Review → [Refactor] → Security → [DevOps] → [Docs] → Done
```

- CodeBase Analyzer optionally produces a Migration Plan artifact — not a separate agent step
- `[...]` stages are optional but strongly recommended when dropping AI Dev Shop into a project with existing code

## Ideal Path (Greenfield)

```
[System Design] → Spec → [Red-Team] → Software Architect → [Database] → TDD → Programmer → [QA/E2E] → TestRunner → Code Review → [Refactor] → Security → [DevOps] → [Docs] → Done
```

- Software Architect conditionally produces `implementation-outline.md` or an explicit SKIP before task generation
- Coordinator generates `tasks.md` from the approved ADR plus implementation-outline readiness before TDD dispatch — not an agent step
- `[Observer]` is passive across all stages when enabled

Each stage is blocked until the Coordinator validates the previous stage's
handoff contract. By default, routing flows through the Coordinator with bounded
cross-agent consultation enabled; if consultation mode is disabled, the
Coordinator uses strict single-agent routing with no consultations.

Specialist agents never own another specialist's lifecycle. They may validate
Coordinator-supplied artifacts from earlier stages and report stale or missing
evidence, but only the Coordinator owns stage ordering, readiness gates, retry
routing, inter-agent dependencies, and human checkpoints. Phrase every
cross-stage requirement as "Coordinator supplies artifact/evidence X to agent
Y," not "agent Y waits for or depends on agent X."

Status, confidence, and evidence labels are defined in
`<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/status-confidence-taxonomy.md`. Do not
translate labels across families; preserve the source label and add the routing
consequence in handoffs.

---

## Contract Checkpoint (Coordinator Duty)

At pipeline start and before each implementation stage, the Coordinator checks host-project contract status per `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/contracts/enforcement.md`:

1. **Pipeline start**: check whether `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/contracts/` exists and which contracts are declared. Report status (active/partial/missing for each). Apply greenfield vs brownfield defaults.
2. **Before Programmer dispatch**: include declared computational controls commands in Programmer context. If runtime-changing work, include runtime-validation contract. If required contracts are missing, escalate to user per enforcement tier (greenfield: ask user to declare; brownfield: note absence and proceed in advisory mode).
3. **Before Programmer handoff**: verify all declared blocking computational checks pass on modified files.
4. **Before TestRunner**: pass declared test commands from computational controls.
5. **Before Code Review**: pass architecture-fitness rules and lint/typecheck results to reviewer context.
6. **At Done gate**: verify no unresolved contract blockers remain. Report contract coverage in pipeline summary.

If a contract is missing and enforcement requires escalation, the Coordinator asks the user before proceeding — it does not silently skip or silently block.

---

## Drift Sensor Checkpoint (Observer Duty)

The Observer reads drift sensor artifacts from `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/sensors/` during maintenance passes per `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/sensors/README.md`.

Sensor findings route into the pipeline as follows:
- **Blocker findings** (critical vulnerability, license violation): Observer escalates immediately regardless of pipeline stage. Coordinator pauses pipeline until resolved.
- **Escalation findings** (coverage decay, major outdated deps, dead-code threshold breach): Observer includes in next maintenance report. Coordinator considers before next feature dispatch.
- **Advisory findings** (minor outdated deps, small coverage dips, new dead code): Logged in maintenance report. No pipeline impact unless sustained over 3+ passes.

The Coordinator does not run sensors directly. Sensors run on their declared schedule. The Observer is the sole consumer and router.

---

## Git Strategy Checkpoint (Coordinator Duty)

At TDD dispatch and Done gate, the Coordinator follows `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/workflows/git-strategy.md`:

1. **Before TDD dispatch**: create feature branch `feature/<NNN>-<feature-slug>` from current main. Record branch in `pipeline-state.md`. All implementation work happens on this branch.
2. **At Done gate**: verify all quality gates passed, prepare PR description from template, signal PR-ready to user. Do not push or merge automatically.

---

## Pre-Pipeline: Existing Codebase Analysis

Run this before the first Spec when working with an existing codebase.

### When to Run

- First time AI Dev Shop is dropped into an existing project
- Codebase has significant existing code that may conflict with new feature work
- Architecture of the existing code is unknown or suspected to be problematic

### CodeBase Analyzer Dispatch

For existing codebases, this is the default first step on the first pass unless a fresh analysis already covers the requested area.

Include in context:
- Path to codebase root (or specific modules to analyze)
- Desired output: analysis only, or analysis + migration plan
- Any known constraints (modules to skip, priority areas)

### Using the Output

The CodeBase Analyzer writes reports to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/`. Two ways to use them:

**Route A — Migration first, then build:**
1. Review `MIGRATION-*.md` with human
2. Execute migration phases using Programmer Agent (each phase = a mini pipeline run)
3. Once codebase reaches target architecture, begin normal delivery pipeline for new features

**Route B — Build alongside migration:**
1. Pass `ANALYSIS-*.md` summary to Software Architect Agent as context for first ADR
2. Software Architect selects patterns that acknowledge current state and plan toward target
3. New features are built clean; migration phases run in parallel as separate pipeline runs

Route B is faster to first feature delivery. Route A is safer for large legacy codebases.

When analysis, migration, or testability reports exist for the active feature,
the Coordinator records their exact paths in `pipeline-state.md` before Spec,
System Design, or Software Architect dispatch. Downstream agents must treat these
reports as sampled evidence with caveats, not as exhaustive proof.

### Software Architect Agent Context When Analysis Exists

When a codebase analysis report exists, include in Software Architect dispatch:
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/ANALYSIS-<id>.md` executive summary
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/MIGRATION-<id>.md` (if generated)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/TESTABILITY-<id>.md` (if generated)
- Flag: "Existing code has [Critical/High] findings — ADR must acknowledge migration path"

---

## Stage-by-Stage Context Injection

What the Coordinator must include in each agent dispatch. Include only what is listed. Extra context degrades attention quality.

### Context Shedding Rule (required)

After `system-blueprint.md` and the active spec package are approved, do not keep injecting raw `vibe` artifacts into downstream implementation stages.

- Allowed downstream context: approved `system-blueprint.md`, active spec package, ADR, tasks, and current-stage artifacts.
- Optional: a short 3-5 bullet intent summary derived from vibe output (if needed), not the full raw vibe transcript.
- Purpose: reduce context drift and avoid conflicting stale tech hints in implementation stages.

### System Design Agent (conditional pre-spec stage)
- Product vision / idea statement (from user or VibeCoder output)
- Known constraints and NFRs
- Existing architecture context (if extending an existing system)
- Relevant CodeBase Analyzer reports when extending an existing system:
  `ANALYSIS-*`, `MIGRATION-*`, and `TESTABILITY-*` paths recorded in
  `pipeline-state.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/system-blueprint/SKILL.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/system-blueprint-template.md`

Output:
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/system-blueprint.md`
- Spec decomposition recommendation (which spec packages to create next and in what order)
- Mandatory `Core/Foundation` package at `P0` to block parallel domain slices until shared shell/primitives are merged
- `Critical User Journeys (Cross-Domain)` list for QA/E2E planning after slice convergence
- Dependency-aware sequencing (`Depends on`) so only dependency-disjoint slices run in parallel

### Spec Agent
- `framework/spec-providers/active-provider.md`
- `framework/spec-providers/<active-provider>/provider.md`
- Product intent from human (verbatim)
- approved `system-blueprint.md` (if produced) for domain boundaries and decomposition guidance.
  If the blueprint is `DRAFT`, `REVISE`, contains unresolved
  `[OWNERSHIP UNCLEAR]`, `Functional model status: BLOCKED`, or
  `NFR model status: BLOCKED`, route back to System Design or human review
  before final spec approval.
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/constitution.md` (for constitution compliance check and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] detection)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` when the feature introduces or changes API style, pagination/filtering policy, error/lifecycle policy, webhook/event shape, or SDK-facing integration behavior
- Relevant entries from `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/project_memory.md` (domain conventions)
- Last 3 entries from `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/learnings.md` (recent failure patterns)
- Existing FEAT folders in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/` (to avoid ID collisions, detect overlap, assign next FEAT number)
- Reverse-spec normalization inputs when this spec is derived from extraction:
  `merged-requirements.md`, `review-digest.md`, `extraction-manifest.md`,
  `coverage-map.md`, `consumer-inventory.md`, `intentional-changes.md`, and
  `characterization-tests/` references. Preserve evidence and confidence
  metadata; do not normalize it away as prose.
- Relevant CodeBase Analyzer reports for brownfield features:
  `ANALYSIS-*`, `MIGRATION-*`, and `TESTABILITY-*` paths recorded in
  `pipeline-state.md`

The Spec Agent must record in `pipeline-state.md`:
- `spec_provider`
- `spec_entrypoint_path`
- `spec_readiness_artifact`
- `spec_hash`
- `provider_mode` when the provider has multiple modes or compatibility/native tracks
- `spec_mode` when the spec is greenfield, brownfield, migration, or reverse-spec derived

The Spec Agent reads, but does not own, upstream state fields such as
`system_blueprint_path`, `system_blueprint_status`, `codebase_analysis_reports`,
`reverse_spec_artifacts`, and `reverse_spec_review_status`. The Coordinator or
the producing upstream stage records those fields before Spec dispatch.

For the default Speckit provider, the existing `spec_path` convention remains valid as a compatibility field.

**Integration contracts:** If the spec depends on another feature's API, data schema, or event contract, the Spec Agent must include an `## Integration Contracts` section in the spec listing:
- Which features this spec depends on (by SPEC-ID)
- The exact interface boundary: endpoint signatures, data shapes, or event names
- Which ACs require the integration to be live

The Coordinator records these dependencies in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/pipeline-state.md`. When all referenced features reach Done, the Coordinator may trigger an optional Integration Verification run against the combined system.

### Red-Team Agent (runs after Spec approval, before Software Architect dispatch)
- Active provider-defined planning surface (full content + hash) — must have zero unresolved clarification blockers
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/constitution.md` (for Constitution pre-flight)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/agents/red-team/skills.md`

**Routing after Red-Team output:**
- 3+ BLOCKING findings → route to Spec Agent with findings; do not dispatch Software Architect
- Any CONSTITUTION_FLAG findings → escalate to human before proceeding
- ADVISORY findings only → run Coordinator Planning Preflight; dispatch Software Architect only if PASS; include advisory list in context
- No findings → run Coordinator Planning Preflight; dispatch Software Architect only if PASS

Red-Team completion must be recorded in `pipeline-state.md` with:
- `red_team_status: PASS | BLOCKING | CONSTITUTION_FLAG | ADVISORY_ONLY`
- `red_team_completed_at`
- `red_team_spec_hash`
- `red_team_artifact`
- `red_team_human_decision` when a CONSTITUTION_FLAG or waiver is involved

### Coordinator Planning Preflight (hard gate before Software Architect dispatch)

Run this preflight before `/plan`, manual Software Architect dispatch, and any resume
that would continue at or beyond `architect`.

The Coordinator cannot dispatch or resume Software Architect until ALL of the following
pass:

- Active provider is resolved from `pipeline-state.md`, and the provider's
  compatibility contract is read before interpreting filenames or readiness.
- `spec_entrypoint_path` exists, is readable, and matches the recorded provider
  hash anchor. Verify with provider-local validator output or a deterministic
  shell command; do not visually or manually compute cryptographic hashes.
  Record `spec_hash_verified_at` only after mechanical verification succeeds.
- `spec_readiness_artifact` exists and passes the provider-defined readiness
  gate.
- The provider-local validator exits successfully. For Speckit preflight, the
  Coordinator sign-off row in `spec-dod.md` is outside the `spec_entrypoint_path`
  hash anchor used for implementation drift detection. Fill or replace the
  Coordinator row first, then run
  `validate_spec_package.py <spec_folder_dir> --phase preflight` without
  `--update-hash`. If a provider places human sign-off inside its hash boundary,
  recompute the provider hash mechanically after signing and update
  `pipeline-state.md` before validation; never validate against a pre-signature
  hash. If `python3` is unavailable, try `python` or `py`; if the validator
  runtime is still unavailable, stop unless `pipeline-state.md` contains a
  human-approved single-line `validator_manual_waiver` with reviewer, timestamp,
  reason, and manual checks performed.
- The spec is human-approved. For Speckit, the `spec-dod.md` Sign-Off Block is
  mandatory: Spec Agent signs before Spec handoff, and Coordinator signs or
  replaces the Coordinator row during this preflight. Provider-specific
  alternatives must be recorded in `pipeline-state.md`.
- Zero unresolved clarification blockers remain in the full provider-defined
  planning surface.
- No banned vague language violations remain.
- Traceability or equivalent planning coverage has no known gaps.
- Implementation-readiness gate passed.
- Red-Team completed against the same `spec_hash`.
- No unresolved Red-Team BLOCKING finding remains.
- Any Red-Team CONSTITUTION_FLAG has an explicit human decision recorded before
  Software Architect dispatch.
- If `system-blueprint.md` exists, its status is `APPROVED`.
- If no blueprint exists and the work is multi-domain, ownership-unclear, or an
  existing-codebase extension, route to System Design before Software Architect.
- No unresolved `[OWNERSHIP UNCLEAR]`, `Functional model status: BLOCKED`, or
  `NFR model status: BLOCKED` condition remains in upstream planning artifacts.
- If reverse-spec artifacts exist, `review-digest.md` was reviewed by a human
  and `reverse_spec_review_status: APPROVED` is recorded.
- If reverse-spec artifacts exist, the planning surface preserves references to
  `extraction-manifest.md`, `coverage-map.md`, `consumer-inventory.md`,
  `intentional-changes.md`, and characterization tests.
- If CodeBase Analyzer reports exist, all relevant `ANALYSIS-*`, `MIGRATION-*`,
  and `TESTABILITY-*` report paths are recorded and included in Software Architect
  context.

Failure recovery:
- Stop at the first failed gate category and report every failed item found in
  the same pass.
- Name the owning stage: System Design, Spec, Red-Team, CodeBase Analyzer, or
  human review.
- Route back to that owner. Do not repair downstream artifacts to make the gate
  pass.
- Update `pipeline-state.md` with
  `planning_preflight_status: FAIL`, `planning_preflight_checked_at`, and
  `planning_preflight_failures`.

When all checks pass, record:
- `planning_preflight_status: PASS`
- `planning_preflight_checked_at`
- `planning_preflight_spec_hash`

### Planning Surface Gate (step 1 of Coordinator Planning Preflight)

The Planning Surface Gate is not a separate dispatch gate. It is the
provider-surface subset and first step of Coordinator Planning Preflight. If it
passes, the Coordinator continues the same preflight with Red-Team, blueprint,
reverse-spec, brownfield, and human-checkpoint checks. If it fails, Software Architect is
not dispatched.

- Active provider is resolved from `pipeline-state.md`
- Provider-defined `spec_entrypoint_path` exists and matches the recorded hash anchor
- Provider-defined `spec_readiness_artifact` exists and passes its gate
- Provider-local validator passed, or an explicit human-approved single-line
  `validator_manual_waiver` is recorded because the runtime was unavailable
- Zero unresolved clarification blockers remain in the provider-defined planning surface
- No banned vague language violations
- Traceability or equivalent planning coverage has no known gaps
- Implementation-readiness gate passed

For the default Speckit provider, apply the compatibility gate defined in `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/speckit/compatibility.md`.

Reference: `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/quality/spec-definition-of-done.md`

### Software Architect Agent
- `framework/spec-providers/active-provider.md`
- `framework/spec-providers/<active-provider>/provider.md`
- Active provider-defined spec entrypoint (full content + hash) — must be human-approved, zero unresolved clarification blockers
- For Speckit: apply the Software Architect read set from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/spec-providers/speckit/compatibility.md` before ADR work begins
- Red-Team findings from `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/red-team-findings.md` (all ADVISORY and CONSTITUTION_FLAG findings; BLOCKING findings mean spec is not yet ready for Software Architect)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/governance/constitution.md` (for Step 0 constitution check)
- Current system boundaries (existing ADRs in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/`)
- Non-functional constraints from spec
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` when the feature exposes or changes an API surface, webhook/event contract, lifecycle policy, or SDK-facing integration boundary
- Relevant `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/references/` files (Coordinator selects based on system drivers in spec)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/ANALYSIS-<id>-<date>.md` executive summary (if produced — treat findings as informed estimates, not guarantees)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/MIGRATION-<id>-<date>.md` (if produced — treat as draft recommendation; validate or refine in ADR)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/TESTABILITY-<id>-<date>.md` (if produced — consume characterization test targets before planning migrated modules)
- Reverse-spec artifacts when produced:
  `extraction-manifest.md`, `coverage-map.md`, `consumer-inventory.md`,
  `intentional-changes.md`, and characterization-test references. Treat them as
  source-of-truth preservation constraints for rewrites and migrations.

**Software Architect outputs (in order):**
1. `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/research.md` (if spec has technology choices) — using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/research-template.md`
2. `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md` — using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/adr-template.md` (includes Constitution Check, Research Summary, Complexity Justification, and API interface decision with rejected alternatives when API design is in scope)
3. `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/implementation-outline.md` (if triggered) — using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/implementation-outline-template.md`. If not triggered, write `Implementation Outline: SKIP - <reason and triggers checked>` to the ADR and Software Architect handoff.

### Database Agent (optional — dispatched alongside or immediately after Software Architect when spec involves data modeling)

When the spec involves data modeling or database operations:
- Coordinator dispatches Database Agent alongside Software Architect, or immediately after ADR is approved
- Database Agent produces:
  - Schema design
  - Entity relationships
  - Migration plan
  - Index recommendations
- If platform = Supabase: Database Agent dispatches to Supabase Sub-Agent for platform-specific implementation
- Schema decisions must be reflected in the ADR before TDD is dispatched

### Coordinator: tasks.md Generation (after ADR human approval, before TDD dispatch)

Coordinator generates `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/tasks.md` using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/tasks-template.md`:
- Before generating `tasks.md`, verify Implementation Outline readiness using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/implementation-outline/SKILL.md`: if a trigger applied, `implementation-outline.md` exists; if no trigger applied, Software Architect recorded `Implementation Outline: SKIP - <reason and triggers checked>`. If neither is present, route back to Software Architect.
- Phases and story order derived from the ADR's parallel delivery plan and AC priorities (P1 first)
- If `implementation-outline.md` exists, derive phase boundaries, story order, and safe `[P]` markers from its Module Map and Wiring Map as well as the ADR.
- If the outline was skipped, record the exact SKIP reason in `tasks.md`.
- `[P]` markers based on independent module boundaries **and** system-blueprint dependency constraints (`Depends on`)
- Do not mark tasks parallel when one task depends on another domain's API/event/schema contract or table ownership boundary
- Constraints section declaring required suites, coverage profile, coverage
  tool/artifact paths, cleanup paths, E2E requirement status, and convergence
  threshold. The default convergence threshold before Code Review is `100%` of
  P1 acceptance tests and invariants passing; any lower threshold requires a
  human-approved value and reason recorded in `tasks.md`.
- Task checkboxes are Coordinator-owned state. Specialist agents treat
  `tasks.md` as read-only unless the Coordinator explicitly delegates a task-list
  update.
- Checkpoint annotation after Phase 1 and after each story phase
- TDD Agent is dispatched only after tasks.md is produced

### TDD Agent
- Active provider-defined planning surface (full content + hash) — **must be human-approved**
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/tasks.md` — generated by Coordinator after ADR approval; defines scope and parallelization for this TDD run
- ADR for the module being tested (`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md`)
- Implementation Outline (`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/implementation-outline.md`) if present, or the recorded SKIP reason from `tasks.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/test-design/SKILL.md`
- Relevant entries from `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/project_memory.md` for the domain
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/TESTABILITY-<id>-<date>.md` (if produced — consume characterization test targets and seam candidates before writing tests for migrated modules)

TDD output must include `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/test-certification.md`
with mechanically verified spec hash, test-file inventory with `sha256` hashes,
expected runnable test count per file, semantic assertion summaries for P1
acceptance criteria and invariants, Outcome Matrix, property/contract test
coverage, and Known Gaps. Parallel TDD gap-fill workers must not write this file
concurrently; they return structured entries to the Coordinator or a single TDD
owner serializes the update.

### Pattern Priming (runs between TDD dispatch and first Programmer dispatch)

Before Programmer begins production implementation, run `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/pattern-priming/SKILL.md`.
The confirmed seed example becomes the reference for similar code in the session.
Repeat pattern priming when the task shifts to a materially different layer or concern.

### Programmer Agent
- Active provider-defined planning surface (hash must match TDD certification hash)
- Certified test names and which ACs they cover
- ADR for the module (architecture constraints)
- Implementation Outline (`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/implementation-outline.md`) if present, or recorded SKIP in `tasks.md`
- Relevant `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/project_memory.md` entries
- Handoff output from TDD Agent (summary only, not full session)
- Confirmed pattern-priming reference (from Pattern Priming step above)
- `progress-ledger.md` when resuming long-running work or when programmer retry count is 2+
- Self-validation harness template when runtime startup, API, UI, auth, migration, or integration behavior is in scope

If broad discovery is required before implementation, use a read-only discovery pass first and pass only structured findings into the Programmer context.

Programmer handoff must include an `Architecture Audit` section:
- `PASS` = no known architectural violations found
- `WARNING` = likely architectural violations or Implementation Outline deviations remain; Coordinator surfaces them to the human and asks whether to route back to Programmer or continue downstream
- `BLOCKER` = ADR/Outline ambiguity or a hard architectural constraint prevents safe continuation; Coordinator pauses routing and escalates
- `Pre-Completion Checklist` = explicit proof that the claimed fix or completion was re-verified against the active task/spec
- `Loop Alert` = required when a loop-detection tripwire fired before handoff
- `Self-Validation` = required when runtime-changing work needed app-level validation before handoff; include status `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, or `BLOCKER`, report path, attempts used, paths checked, any bounded diagnosis pass used, and any offloaded evidence

### TestRunner Agent
- Test suite location
- Spec hash certified by TDD Agent (to validate drift)
- Active provider-defined planning surface path so TestRunner can mechanically
  hash the current spec file and compare it to the certified hash
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/test-certification.md`
  so TestRunner can verify test-file hashes and expected test count before
  execution
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/tasks.md`
  constraints for required suites, coverage profile, convergence threshold,
  coverage tool/artifacts, cleanup paths, and E2E requirement status
- Previous cycle's failure clusters (to detect regressions)
- Self-validation report path when one was produced during implementation
- Coverage tool (from `tasks.md` constraints section; if absent, use project default)
- Active coverage profile for lines/branches/functions/statements by suite (from `tasks.md` constraints):
  - defaults: unit `98/98/98/98`, integration `90/90/90/90`, e2e `80/80/80/80`
  - if user provides custom minimums, those override defaults
- Per-file coverage baseline (from `tasks.md` constraints section if present, used to flag regressions on touched files)

Before running tests, TestRunner purges configured coverage artifact paths so
stale reports cannot inflate the result. A required suite with no current
machine-readable coverage artifact is `UNAVAILABLE` and cannot pass. Zero tests
executed, skipped-only runs, stale spec hash, test-file hash mismatch, expected
test count mismatch, and unapproved flaky tests are blocking results. E2E is
reported as N/A only when it is not required by `tasks.md`, the active spec, or a
Coordinator directive.

Passing suites should be summarized briefly. Failing suites should include exact output or an offload path if the raw output is large.

After accepting the TestRunner report, the Coordinator creates or updates
`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/verification-packet.md`
from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/templates/verification-packet-template.md`.
Code Review receives this Coordinator-owned packet, not raw assumptions about
stage readiness.

### Code Review Agent
- Full diff of changed files
- Active provider-defined planning surface (for alignment check)
- ADR for the module (for architecture compliance check)
- Coordinator verification packet for the same spec hash, usually built from
  `test-certification.md` and the latest accepted verification report. It must
  include test-file hash verification, executed vs expected count,
  required-suite status, coverage gate status, and flaky-test status.
- Test file source code for every test path in the certification inventory that
  maps to changed behavior or P1/invariant coverage
- Programmer's most recent handoff table and `progress-ledger.md` when function
  quality debt-band fix evidence is claimed
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/code-review/SKILL.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/security-review/SKILL.md` (for surface flagging)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` when the diff changes API style, pagination/filtering policy, error model, lifecycle policy, webhook semantics, or SDK-facing ergonomics
- Previous Code Review findings (to detect recurrence)

### Refactor Agent
- Specific Code Review findings classified as Recommended
- Affected file contents
- ADR constraints (to verify refactors stay within architecture)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/refactor-patterns/SKILL.md`

### Security Agent
- Full diff of changed files
- Active provider-defined planning surface (for business logic abuse vector analysis)
- List of changed auth/payment/data paths (Coordinator identifies these from the diff)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/security-review/SKILL.md`

### QA/E2E Agent (runs after Programmer)
- Active provider-defined planning surface (full content + hash)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/system-blueprint.md` (if produced; prioritize `Critical User Journeys (Cross-Domain)`)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md`
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/test-certification.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/e2e-test-architecture/SKILL.md`
- Coordinator directive specifying which ACs require E2E coverage

### DevOps Agent (runs after Security, before Docs)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md`
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/security/SEC-<feature-id>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- Active provider-defined NFR section or equivalent planning constraint surface
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/devops-delivery/SKILL.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/infrastructure-as-code/SKILL.md`
- Coordinator directive specifying scope (new infra / CI update / runbook only / full)

### Docs Agent (runs after DevOps, before Done)
- Active provider-defined planning surface, plus any explicit API contract artifact if present
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/adr.md`
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/security/SEC-<feature-id>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- Existing `CHANGELOG.md`
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` when documenting API style decisions, lifecycle policy, webhook/event contracts, or integration ergonomics
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/api-contracts/SKILL.md`
- Coordinator directive specifying doc deliverables required

### Observer Agent (runs alongside, not in sequence)
- All agent outputs from the current cycle (summaries, not full sessions)
- Previous Observer reports (for trend analysis)
- `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/memory/learnings.md` (to cross-reference new patterns against known ones)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/maintenance/observer-cadence.md` (for cadence triggers, doc-garden workflow, and benchmark refresh rules)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/quality/failure-promotion-policy.md` (for mandatory promotion when failure classes recur)

**Minimum Observer cadence:**
- after every 3rd completed feature
- immediately after any convergence escalation
- before merge for toolkit-maintenance changes touching `AGENTS.md`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `framework/spec-providers/`, `framework/workflows/`, `framework/templates/`, `framework/slash-commands/`, or `harness-engineering/`
- weekly while framework-maintenance work is active

**Toolkit-maintenance pass requirements:**
- run `bash harness-engineering/validators/run-all.sh`
- capture the doc-garden audit output in the Observer report
- review benchmark impact when instructions or routing docs changed
- recommend a concrete harness artifact when a failure class reaches the promotion threshold

## Routing Rules (Coordinator-owned)

| Finding | Route To | Context to Include |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-domain or unclear boundaries before spec exists | System Design Agent | Product intent, constraints, current architecture context |
| Spec human-approved | Red-Team Agent | Full spec, spec hash, constitution.md |
| Red-Team: 3+ BLOCKING | Spec Agent | All BLOCKING findings with exact spec refs |
| Red-Team: CONSTITUTION_FLAG | Human → Spec Agent | Flag details, relevant constitution article |
| Red-Team: ADVISORY only | Coordinator Planning Preflight, then Software Architect if PASS | Spec, spec hash, advisory list, provider gate, blueprint/reverse-spec/brownfield evidence |
| Test failures | Programmer | Failing test names, spec ACs, ADR constraints |
| `[ARCHITECTURE_REVISION_REQUEST]` from downstream agent | Coordinator escalation flow | Blocking technical constraint, failed alternatives, impacted artifacts (spec/ADR/tasks/tests), requested revision scope |
| Coverage gaps (any type) | TDD Agent (triage first) | Coverage Gap List (High-priority first), current % vs threshold per file, spec hash, test certification record — TDD classifies each gap as spec-traceable (writes tests) or no-spec-mapping (flags to Coordinator for Refactor dispatch) |
| Coverage gaps — no spec mapping (flagged by TDD triage) | Refactor Agent | `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/coverage-triage-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, Coverage Gap List, uncovered files with line ranges, ADR constraints |
| Touched-file coverage regression | Coordinator routing triage first — uses TestRunner/TDD evidence plus diff metadata, then routes to TDD (tests deleted) or Programmer (implementation removed covered path) | Regressed files, previous vs current %, diff metadata, latest coverage evidence |
| Required test-quality, stale certification, test-file hash, semantic assertion, or required coverage-evidence finding from Code Review | TDD Agent | Code Review finding IDs, active spec hash, test certification, Coordinator verification packet, affected tests/spec refs |
| Architecture violation | Software Architect | Specific violation, which ADR was breached |
| Spec ambiguity | Spec Agent | Exact ambiguity, what decision is blocked |
| Security finding (Critical/High) | Programmer | Full finding, mitigation steps; Security verifies after fix |
| Security finding (Medium/Low) | Log and continue | — |
| Refactor findings | Refactor Agent | Specific CR finding IDs marked Recommended |
| Refactor proposals accepted by human | Programmer (refactor scope) | Accepted proposals with file refs, ADR constraints — no new TDD, no behavior changes, tests must stay green |
| All integration-contract dependencies Done | Integration Verification (optional) | Integration contracts from each dependent spec, combined test suite |
| `[OUTLINE_REQUESTED]` from TDD or Programmer | Software Architect | Missing boundary, contract, or wiring decision; after outline or SKIP update, Coordinator regenerates `tasks.md` if phase order, file scope, or `[P]` markers change |
| Spec misalignment in code | Programmer or Spec Agent | Which requirement, what code does vs what spec says |

## Convergence Policy

- **Threshold**: default `100%` of P1 acceptance tests and invariants passing
  before advancing to Code Review, plus every hard coverage gate in `tasks.md`
  constraints. A lower threshold is allowed only when a human-approved value and
  reason are recorded in `tasks.md`; failing P1 tests, invariant tests, stale
  hashes, missing required coverage artifacts, zero-test runs, or unapproved
  flaky tests still block advancement.
- **Iteration budget**: 5 total retries across all clusters; escalate any single failing cluster after 3 retries — see `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/framework/governance/escalation-policy.md`

---

## Human Checkpoints (Blocking)

| Checkpoint | Trigger | What Human Decides |
|---|---|---|
| Spec approval | Before Software Architect dispatch — requires zero unresolved clarification blockers | Is this planning surface complete and correct? |
| Architecture sign-off | Before tasks.md generation and TDD dispatch — requires clean Constitution Check and Implementation Outline readiness | Is this ADR acceptable? Are all constitution exceptions justified? Is the outline/SKIP decision acceptable? |
| Convergence escalation | When iteration budget exhausted | Is the spec wrong? Is this a fundamental constraint? |
| Security sign-off | Before merge/deploy | Accept, mitigate, or reject Critical/High findings |
| Refactor review | After Refactor Agent delivers proposals | Accept or reject each proposal; accepted proposals are dispatched to Programmer |

---

## Done State

A feature reaches **Done** when all of the following are true:
1. All three human checkpoints cleared: spec approval, architecture sign-off, security sign-off
2. All tests pass against the certified spec hash
3. All Critical/High security findings are resolved, or accepted with documented rationale in `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/pipeline-state.md`
4. Final TestRunner artifact shows current spec hash verification, certified
   test-file hash verification, executed test count greater than zero and at
   least the certified expected count, no unapproved flaky tests, and required
   suites PASS or explicitly N/A by `tasks.md`.
5. Coverage report is attached to the final TestRunner artifact; hard gates pass
   per metric using the active profile (defaults: unit lines/branches/functions/statements
   >= 98%, integration lines/branches/functions/statements >= 90%, e2e
   lines/branches/functions/statements >= 80% when E2E is required); all
   High-priority gaps are resolved or explicitly accepted with risk rationale;
   no uncovered lines remain in changed/high-priority runtime paths without
   documented technical justification.

The Coordinator issues a **merge-ready summary** to the human:
```
MERGE-READY — <SPEC-ID> v<version>

Spec:     <SPEC-ID> v<version> (hash: <hash>)
Tests:    <N> passing, certified against hash <hash>
ADR:      <path>
Approvals: spec ✓  architecture ✓  security ✓
Security: <"all resolved" | list of accepted-with-rationale findings>
```

The human decides whether to merge. The pipeline does not merge automatically.

## Parallel Execution

When the Software Architect defines independent modules (natural in Vertical Slice, Modular Monolith, Microservices):

1. Coordinator identifies non-overlapping test clusters per module
2. Dispatches separate Programmer instances per module simultaneously
3. Each instance works against its own isolated test set
4. Coordinator dispatches one TestRunner aggregation job for the feature cycle
   after parallel workers complete
5. Code Review receives the full combined diff — not individual slices
6. Security receives the combined diff

Parallel rules:
- Respect the system-blueprint dependency graph: slices linked by `Depends on` must be serialized; only dependency-disjoint slices run in parallel
- If a slice depends on another domain's table ownership (FK dependency), sequence it to a later wave after the owner slice merges
- Modules must have no shared mutable state
- No Programmer instance writes to a file another instance reads
- If a shared utility needs changes, serialize — do not parallelize changes to shared code
- Parallel TestRunner workers are not supported for the same feature cycle.
  Coordinator dispatches one TestRunner aggregation job after parallel work
  completes. That job owns coverage cleanup, isolated per-suite output paths,
  and merged coverage evaluation for the cycle.

---

## Context Compression at Scale

For long-running projects where pipeline histories grow large:

- **Cycle summaries only**: Pass the Coordinator's cycle summary to the next cycle, not the full agent output logs
- **Observation masking**: Replace verbose TestRunner output (`Full test output: 2,400 lines`) with a structured summary (`47 passing, 3 failing: [AC-03, INV-01, EC-02]`)
- **Selective memory injection**: Load only the 5 most recent learnings.md entries plus any entries matching the current module's domain terms
- **Projection forward**: If a decision was made in cycle 1 and is still active, reference the ADR — do not re-include the original Software Architect reasoning in cycle 5 dispatches

---

## Pipeline State Tracking

The Coordinator maintains a state record per run:

```
Pipeline Run: RUN-007
Spec: SPEC-001 v1.2 (hash: abc123)
Human-approved: 2026-02-21T10:00:00Z

Stage status:
  Spec:         DONE  (2026-02-21T10:00:00Z)
  Software Architect:    DONE  (ADR-003, 2026-02-21T10:30:00Z)
  TDD:          DONE  (47 tests certified against hash abc123)
  Programmer:   IN PROGRESS (cycle 2, 44/47 passing)
  TestRunner:   —
  Code Review:  —
  Security:     —

Active failure clusters:
  AC-03 (Invoice zero-quantity edge case): 2/5 cycle budget
  EC-02 (Idempotency): 1/5 cycle budget

Risk level: Medium
Convergence: 93.6% (threshold: 95%)
```

---

## Escalation Format

When escalating to human, the Coordinator must include:

1. **What is stuck**: Exact test names, spec references, or finding IDs
2. **Full failure history**: Each cycle's attempt and why it didn't resolve it
3. **The decision needed**: Is the spec wrong? Is this a fundamental constraint? Is the architecture unsuitable?
4. **Impact of each option**: If we fix the spec this way, what downstream tests need to be rewritten?
