## Triage Results

One row per file in the Coverage Gap List. Every file must be classified — no blanks.

| File | Module Class | Current % | Target % | Gap Type | Spec Refs | Recommended Route | Notes |
|------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| `src/services/invoice.ts` | Core business logic | 61% | 95% | spec-traceable | AC-03, INV-01 | TDD gap fill | Missing negative path for zero-quantity line items |
| `src/utils/legacy-calculator.ts` | Core business logic | 22% | 95% | no-spec-mapping | — | Refactor Agent | Tightly coupled, no injectable seams; candidate for seam extraction |
| `src/config/constants.ts` | Configuration | — | Exempt | exempt | — | No action | No runtime logic |

**Gap types:**
- `spec-traceable` — uncovered path maps to a known requirement, invariant, or edge case in the spec; TDD writes missing tests
- `no-spec-mapping` — uncovered path cannot be traced to any spec item; may be dead code, untestable coupling, or out-of-scope implementation; route to Coordinator for Refactor dispatch
- `exempt` — file is configuration, type-only, or otherwise exempt per the risk-weighted threshold table

## Summary

- Total files below threshold: <N>
- spec-traceable gaps: <N> (TDD will write tests — listed below)
- no-spec-mapping gaps: <N> (routing to Coordinator for Refactor dispatch — listed below)
- exempt files: <N>

### spec-traceable — TDD will write tests

| File | Missing Coverage | Spec Ref | Priority |
|------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| | | | |

### no-spec-mapping — Coordinator decision needed

| File | Why No Spec Mapping | Suspected Cause | Priority |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|

## Updated Certification Record

After gap fill tests are written, update the certification record at:
`<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/pipeline/<NNN>-<feature-name>/test-certification.md`

- Do not change the original certified spec hash
- Refuse gap fill if the active spec hash no longer matches the certification
  record; full recertification is required instead
- Add new tests to the Covered Requirements table
- Add or update the Test File Inventory with sha256 hashes and expected runnable
  test counts for every new or changed test file, and remove inventory rows for
  deleted test files so the inventory exactly matches disk
- Revise the Known Gaps section
- Update the certified timestamp
- If multiple gap-fill workers are active, workers must not write the
  certification record concurrently; return structured inventory-delta entries
  to the Coordinator or a Coordinator-designated single writer

## Handoff

- Suggested next: Coordinator
- Coordinator routes spec-traceable items back to TDD for test writing (if not already written in this session)
- Coordinator routes no-spec-mapping items to Refactor Agent with this triage report as context
