# Skills Registry Exceptions

Use this file only when a canonical shared skill should exist on disk but should not appear in `skills-registry.md`.

Default rule: shared skills under `skills/*/SKILL.md` must be registered. This file is the narrow escape hatch for deliberate exclusions.

## Format

- one bullet per excluded skill path
- wrap the path in backticks
- explain the reason in plain language after the path

Example:

Example entry: `skills/<deprecated-skill>/SKILL.md` — deprecated but kept temporarily for migration support

## Current Exceptions

- `skills/supabase-upstream/SKILL.md` — official Supabase vendor drop; loaded only through progressive disclosure references in `skills/supabase/SKILL.md` and `agents/database/supabase/skills.md`; not a standalone agent skill
- `skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices/SKILL.md` — official Supabase vendor drop; loaded only through progressive disclosure references in `skills/supabase/SKILL.md`, `skills/postgresql/SKILL.md`, and `agents/database/supabase/skills.md`; not a standalone agent skill
