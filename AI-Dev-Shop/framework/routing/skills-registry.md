# Skills Registry

This is the **single source of truth** for all skills in the toolkit.

## What Is a Skill?

A skill is a reusable capability module that agents load at dispatch time. Skills are not agents — they have no persona, no routing identity, and no reserved name. An agent composes one or more skills to do its work.

## Convention

Every skill lives at: `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

`SKILL.md` is the entrypoint. Some skills have additional files (templates, schemas, examples) alongside it.

## How Skills Are Used

1. The Coordinator resolves which agent handles a task.
2. That agent's `agents/<name>/skills.md` lists which skills it loads.
3. The agent reads each skill's `SKILL.md` before starting work.

Skills can be conditionally activated — loaded only when a specific task type triggers them.

## Adding or Removing a Skill

1. Create (or delete) `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Add (or remove) the mapping row in the table below.
3. Update the consuming agent's `agents/<name>/skills.md`.

Do NOT maintain a duplicate skill list anywhere else. This file is the only inventory.

## Skill → Agent Mapping

All agents draw from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/`. Do not duplicate skill content in agent files — reference the skill file instead.
