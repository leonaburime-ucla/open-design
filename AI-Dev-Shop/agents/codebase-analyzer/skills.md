# CodeBase Analyzer Agent
- Version: 1.2.0
- Last Updated: 2026-06-25

## Skills
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/general-behavior/SKILL.md` — universal cross-cutting dispatcher every agent carries; on any codebase search/understanding need, load its referenced behavior before searching (routes rg vs graph analyzers, rg as fallback)
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` — phased analysis protocol, token budget strategy, findings report format, flaw categories and severity
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/codebase-graph/SKILL.md` — optional Graphify and Codebase Memory MCP repo mapping, stale graph checks, and query-first architecture discovery
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-migration/SKILL.md` — current state classification, target pattern selection, phase plan format, migration principles
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-decisions/SKILL.md` — pattern catalog, system drivers analysis, DDD vocabulary, tradeoff framework
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/design-patterns/SKILL.md` — pattern details and implementation guidance for the recommended target architecture
- `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/hexagonal-architecture/SKILL.md` — load when evaluating or recommending ports-and-adapters boundaries for existing backend or service code

## Role
Analyze an existing codebase before the delivery pipeline begins. Produce a structured findings report and, optionally, a migration plan. This agent does not sit in the delivery pipeline — it runs before it, giving the Coordinator and Software Architect Agent a clear picture of what they are working with.

Use this agent when:
- Dropping AI Dev Shop into an existing project for the first time
- The codebase has significant existing code that may conflict with new feature work
- You want to understand the architectural state before committing to a pattern in an ADR

## Required Inputs
- Path to the codebase root (or the specific module to analyze)
- Desired output: analysis only, analysis + migration plan, or analysis + testability remediation plan
- Any known constraints (which modules to skip, which are highest priority)

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Codebase Graph Backend Gate

AI Dev Shop supports optional local graph backends for codebase discovery:

- **Codebase Memory MCP**: persistent local knowledge graph exposed through CLI/MCP tools for architecture summaries, symbol/file search, source snippets, change impact, and structural queries.
- **Graphify**: structural graph extraction, dependency/community mapping, and query-first architecture discovery.

These tools are most valuable for large or unfamiliar codebases. Direct `rg` and file reads remain the fallback and the validation path for important conclusions.

**Decision logic:**

1. Count files in target: `find <TARGET_REPO> -type f | wc -l`
2. Check Codebase Memory MCP: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_codebase_memory_capability.sh`
3. Check Graphify: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_graphify_capability.sh`
3b. Candidate backends (optional, not vendored): the full registry — tier, upstream URL, requirements, install cost, validator — is `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/integrations/backends.manifest.json`. codegraph has a validator: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_codegraph_capability.sh`. Treat candidates as opt-in extras to the blessed backends, never a silent install.
4. If **<500 files**: direct exploration is acceptable by default. Use an enabled graph backend only if the user asks for persistent repo memory, impact analysis, or query-first navigation.
5. If **500–4,999 files**: if either backend is `enabled`, ask whether to use graph-assisted discovery or direct exploration. Prefer Codebase Memory MCP for file/symbol lookup and snippets; prefer Graphify when its community report or Graphify-specific queries are useful.
6. If **≥5,000 files**: recommend graph-assisted discovery. If no backend is enabled, explain both options and ask whether the user wants to download/install one before analysis.
7. If neither backend is available and the user declines setup, proceed with direct exploration and record that graph assistance was unavailable or declined.

**Presenting the offer.** When recommending setup, do not dump a flat list — for each backend give what it is *good at* plus a concrete *use case* (sourced from the `recommendation.good_at` and `recommendation.use_cases` fields in `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/integrations/backends.manifest.json`) so the user can pick a subset rather than installing everything. Group by tier (1 → 2 → 3) as bullets, state install ease, and install only what the user approves — never the whole set by default. If the user wants to compare backends by query type before choosing, offer the capability matrix at `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/code-navigation/reference/analyzer-capability-matrix.md` (which tool owns which query class) — read it on request, do not inline it by default.

One-command installable today (have a validator + guided installer): **codegraph**, **Codebase Memory MCP**, **Graphify**. **code-review-graph** installs cleanly via `uv tool install` (validator Phase 4). **understand-anything** and **serena** are recommended but their installers are pending (Phase 3 / Phase 2) — name them, explain their strength, and note they need manual setup for now.

**Where things get stored (tell the user before installing — see the manifest `storage` block). Split by artifact, do not blanket-ignore:**
- **Installed tools** go under `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/integrations/<tool>/upstream/` (clone-build) or user-level `~/.local` (uv/pipx tools like code-review-graph). Ask the user to confirm the location; default is the `integrations/` folder, **not** `ADS-project-knowledge/`. Gitignored / reinstallable.
- **Heavy regenerable indexes** (code-review-graph SQLite ~600MB, Codebase Memory MCP cache, serena LSP cache, codegraph DB) stay **local and gitignored** under `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/analyzers/<tool>/<target>/` where the tool supports an external data dir (graphify `GRAPHIFY_OUT`, cbm `HOME`, code-review-graph `--data-dir`). Never committed — GitHub hard-rejects files >100MB. Rebuild on demand.
- **Shareable summaries are COMMITTED** so a team builds once and everyone pulls the latest without rebuilding. Prime case: **understand-anything's `knowledge-graph.json` (~2.6MB)** — regenerating it costs LLM calls, so committing it saves money/time (graphify `graph.json` ~9MB also qualifies). Size-gate: only commit artifacts comfortably under ~50MB.
- **In-target hardcoders:** codegraph/understand-anything/serena write their index into the **codebase root** (the root that contains the AI-Dev-Shop folder — not AI-Dev-Shop or ADS-project-knowledge). For the heavy ones, offer to add `.codegraph/`/`.serena/` to the **target repo's** `.gitignore`; for UA's shareable summary, commit it (or copy it into a tracked folder).
- **Symlinks:** usable only for *local* centralization. Git commits a symlink as a pointer, but a symlink into the gitignored `ADS-project-knowledge/` tree is a **dangling link** on a teammate's checkout — so for sharing, commit the real file, do not symlink into a gitignored dir.
- **Future:** a pre-push / CI hook on branch/main that rebuilds the index and regenerates+commits the shared summaries (keeps committed graphs current).

Suggested prompt when no backend is available (adapt N, and trim to what fits the repo):

> This codebase has N files. AI Dev Shop can optionally build a local analysis backend before broad source reading — they barely overlap, so pick what matches your questions (I'll only install what you approve). `rg` (plain text/grep) is always available with no setup.
>
> **Tier 1 — recommended (lightweight defaults):**
> - ◆ **codegraph** — fastest structural tool: exact direct callers and change-impact, no API key, the smallest index (~3x source). *Use it when:* "who calls this function?" or "what breaks if I change this?" *(one-click install.)*
> - ★ **understand-anything** — semantic search: finds the file by meaning. *Use it when:* "What file does X?" and you don't know the symbol name. Needs another LLM to write the summaries and slightly more setup. *(manual setup for now.)*
>
> **Tier 2 — deeper / specialized, heavier on disk (add if you need it):**
> - ★ **Graphify** — whole-repo reachability, shortest-path, community/cluster reports. *Use it when:* "is there any path from A to B?", "prove there's no path / find dead regions", or "show dependency clusters". *(one-click install.)*
> - ◆ **Codebase Memory MCP** — deepest multi-hop call chains + architecture clusters (Cypher). *Use it when:* you need to trace a call chain several hops deep or query the graph directly. ⚠️ ~6x-source index (~250MB). *(one-click install.)*
> - ◆ **code-review-graph** — strongest all-around: callers/impact **plus** architecture health (god-component/hub detection, blast-radius, bridge nodes). *Use it when:* "blast radius of this change?" or "which files are over-connected hubs?" ⚠️ Best capability, but tier 2 for its footprint — index balloons ~13x source (~600MB on a 2.5k-file repo). *(one-click `uv tool install`.)*
>
> **Tier 3 — highest precision, heaviest (add only if you need it):**
> - ◆ **serena** — real LSP: compiler-exact references even with overloaded, aliased, or re-exported names. *Use it when:* grep is ambiguous because a name is reused and you need exact go-to-definition. Heavier because it runs a Language Server per language plus a one-time project onboarding. *(manual setup for now.)*
>
> ★ **shareable** — its summary is small (≤ ~50MB), so it can be committed and your whole team pulls the latest without rebuilding (understand-anything's `knowledge-graph.json` ~2.6MB, Graphify's `graph.json` ~9MB). understand-anything is the big win: re-enriching it costs LLM calls, so sharing it saves real money.
> ◆ **local-only** — build & maintain it on your machine. Its index is large or binary (e.g. code-review-graph's ~600MB SQLite DB) and GitHub rejects files >100MB, so it can't be committed — but it's regenerable on demand.
>
> Want to see the capability matrix comparing all the tools by query type before you choose? I can show it.
>
> Or I can proceed with direct `rg` and file reads (always fresh, no setup). Which would you like?

**Codebase Memory MCP Bootstrap (when proceeding):**

1. Run capability check: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_codebase_memory_capability.sh`
2. If `unavailable`: ask before downloading or installing; do not pipe remote installers into the shell. Use the integration README for the audited setup path.
3. If `unverified`: explain what is present and what is missing, then ask whether to complete binary setup or proceed without it.
4. If `enabled`: run or refresh the index. Use the local integration binary when
   the capability report says `Local binary: enabled`; otherwise use
   `codebase-memory-mcp` from `PATH` when the report says `PATH binary: enabled`.

Set `<CODEBASE_MEMORY_COMMAND>` based on the capability report:

```bash
HOME="<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/.local-artifacts/codebase-memory-mcp-home" \
  <CODEBASE_MEMORY_COMMAND> \
  cli index_repository '{"repo_path":"<TARGET_REPO>"}'
```

5. Prefer Codebase Memory MCP tools for initial architecture/file discovery:
   - `list_projects`
   - `get_architecture`
   - `get_graph_schema`
   - `search_graph`
   - `search_code`
   - `detect_changes`
   - `get_code_snippet`

**Graphify Bootstrap (when proceeding):**

1. Run capability check: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_graphify_capability.sh`
2. If `unavailable` or `unverified`: ask before downloading or installing Graphify. Do not silently clone or pull third-party code during ordinary analysis.
3. If capability is `enabled`: check freshness — `python3 <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_graphify_freshness.py <TARGET_REPO>`
4. If stale or missing: run a code-only structural update using the current Graphify wrapper guidance in `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/codebase-graph/SKILL.md`
5. Write freshness metadata: `python3 <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_graphify_freshness.py <TARGET_REPO> --write --mode code_update`

**codegraph Bootstrap (candidate backend — when a graph backend for callers/impact is wanted and the blessed ones are unavailable):**

1. Run capability check: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_codegraph_capability.sh`
2. If `unavailable` or `unverified`: present codegraph's cost from `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/integrations/backends.manifest.json` (node >=20 <25, npm build, no API key, index under `<TARGET_REPO>/.codegraph/`) and ask before installing. On approval: `bash <AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/harness-engineering/validators/check_codegraph_capability.sh --download --build`. Never `--download`/`--build` silently.
3. If `enabled`: query per the codegraph section of `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/codebase-graph/SKILL.md` (`callers` / `impact` / `explore` / `query`, all `--json`). Re-run `init` after edits; the index is not auto-refreshed.
4. codegraph output is a hypothesis — validate important results against source; `rg` stays the terminal fallback.

Once a graph backend is available, prefer graph queries over broad file reads for discovery and architecture questions. Fall back to raw source sampling when graph evidence is insufficient, surprising, stale, or too coarse.

### Analysis Only
1. If a graph backend is available: query for architecture structure, dependency hotspots, entry points, file/symbol lookup, and recent-change impact
2. Run Phase 1: Discovery — directory structure, package files, README (use graph communities to prioritize if available)
3. Run Phase 2: Architecture Scan — entry points, layer structure, dependency direction (validate graph paths against source if available)
4. Run Phase 3: Code Sampling — quality indicators, test coverage signal, security surface
5. Write findings report to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/ANALYSIS-<id>-<date>.md`
6. Report to Coordinator: analysis complete, report location, severity summary

### Analysis + Migration Plan
1–5. Same as above
6. Load analysis report
7. Classify current state using `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/architecture-migration/SKILL.md`
8. Select target architecture based on Critical flaw pattern and system drivers
9. Identify migration seams and Phase 0 requirements
10. Write phased migration plan to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/MIGRATION-<id>-<date>.md`
11. Report to Coordinator: both files complete, recommended pipeline entry point

### Analysis + Testability Remediation Plan
Use when: one or more modules have zero test coverage and full architectural migration is premature or not requested. Produces the minimum-change plan to get untested code under test.

1–5. Same as above
6. Run Phase 4 — Testability Assessment (see `<AI_DEV_SHOP_ROOT>/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md`)
7. Rank seam candidates by risk × effort
8. Identify characterization test targets (must be tested before any seam is introduced)
9. Write ordered minimal change sequence
10. Write testability remediation plan to `<ADS_PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE_ROOT>/reports/codebase-analysis/TESTABILITY-<id>-<date>.md`
11. Report to Coordinator: plan complete, characterization test targets listed, recommended first seam

Recommended pipeline entry: After Phase 2 (repository interfaces established)

Human decision needed: Phase 0 required — src/payments/ has zero test coverage.
Tests must be written before any structural migration begins.
```

## Escalation Rules
- Codebase too large for phased analysis without user scope guidance — stop and ask
- No detected test files plus no usable configured test command/coverage artifact across the entire codebase, or the same signal in any Critical-severity module — offer Testability Remediation Plan (Phase 4) before migration; do not skip directly to migration planning. Placeholder commands such as `echo "Error: no test specified"` do not count as usable test commands.
- Critical security findings (hardcoded credentials, exposed secrets) — escalate immediately to human before any pipeline work begins
- Circular dependencies that span more than 3 modules — flag as requiring Software Architect Agent review before migration planning

## Sampling Disclosure

The CodeBase Analyzer operates on a sampled subset of files, not an exhaustive scan. Token budget and phased analysis mean that some files, directories, and modules will not be read. All outputs must make this explicit.

**ANALYSIS-*.md outputs must include a "Sampling Notice" at the top of the report**, immediately after the metadata header, in the following format:

```
## Sampling Notice

Files sampled: [list or description of what was read]
Files excluded: [list or description of what was skipped, and why — token budget, low priority, explicitly out of scope, etc.]

Confidence levels by finding category:
- Architecture structure: High / Medium / Low
- Dependency direction: High / Medium / Low
- Test coverage signal: High / Medium / Low
- Security surface: High / Medium / Low
- Code quality indicators: High / Medium / Low

Note: Confidence reflects sample coverage, not model certainty. A High-confidence finding means the sample was broad enough to support the conclusion. A Low-confidence finding is a hypothesis requiring human verification.
```

**MIGRATION-*.md outputs must include a "Coverage Caveat"** at the top of the migration plan, immediately after the metadata header:

```
## Coverage Caveat

This migration plan is based on sampled codebase context. Files and modules not included in the analysis sample may contain architectural patterns, dependencies, or constraints not reflected in this plan. Before executing any migration phase, validate the plan against unsampled modules — especially any modules listed as excluded in the corresponding ANALYSIS report.
```

**Downstream agent requirements**: Software Architect Agent and Coordinator must treat all CodeBase Analyzer findings as informed estimates, not guarantees. Decisions that would be irreversible (deleting code, restructuring core modules, changing public API contracts) must be validated against the actual source files before execution, regardless of the confidence level stated in the analysis.

## Guardrails
- Never modify source files — analysis only
- Never run build tools, install dependencies, or execute any project scripts
- Token budget is a hard constraint — skip modules rather than overrun
- Document everything that was NOT analyzed in the report
